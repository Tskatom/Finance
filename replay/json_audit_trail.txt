Shah Deniz, a gas deposit group led by BP Plc (BP/) , is expected by July to choose between the two projects to transport 10 billion cubic meters of gas annually to the European Union. The group\u2019s partners also include Statoil ASA (STL) , Total SA (FP) and State Oil Company of Azerbaijan, or Socar.\n\u201cOur message to Shah Deniz is that TAP is less costly as it\u2019s shorter, and that all the governments involved support it,\u201d Klisovic said in an interview in his office in Zagreb today. \u201cThis includes Italy, which is one of the biggest gas consumers in Europe.\u201d\nEU nations want to curb their reliance on gas deliveries from Russia through Ukraine after disruption in recent years over price disputes. TAP\u2019s 800-kilometer (500-mile) route would go through Turkey through Greece, and Albania to Italy, while the 1,300-kilometer Nabucco would traverse Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary.\nGas Consumption\nGas consumption in the former Yugoslav region and Albania will double by 2020 to 11 billion cubic meters of gas a year, according to an October 2011 study by state-owned pipeline operator Plinacro d.o.o.\nCroatia , which needs about 1 billion cubic meters of gas a year, wants to meet the increased demand by diversifying its supplies.\nFrom the Albanian town of Fier, an interconnector would lead toward Montenegro and further on to Croatia, joining the existing pipeline at Split and ending at the island of Krk in the northern Adriatic, where Croatia plans to build a liquefied natural-gas terminal, Klisovic said. An off-shoot pipeline to Hungary is also planned, he said.\n\u201cCroatia supports the TAP project as it gives us the possibility to diversify our gas supply,\u201d Klisovic said. Diversification plans \u201cprobably\u201d include a connector to the South Stream gas pipeline project, whose main stakeholder is Russia\u2019s Gazprom OAO (GAZP) , as well as the building of an LNG terminal on Krk, he said.\nTerminal Studies\nPre-feasibility and environment studies for the terminal, estimated at 700 million euros ($929 million) are completed, and the government will proceed with seeking strategic partners in the fall, Klisovic said.\nThe OMV AG-led Nabucco pipeline project said it can offer bigger markets and greater potential for exports should it win the right to ship natural gas from Azerbaijan\u2019s Shah Deniz field to Europe over a rival proposal, Christian Dolezal, communications chief of Nabucco Gas Pipeline International GmbH, said in March.\nAzerbaijan said in February it favors TAP.

The currency extended gains versus the dollar as Treasuries rallied even after demand slumped at a Treasury auction of three-year notes. Australia \u2019s dollar dropped to an almost three-year low after data showed home-loan approvals expanded by less than economists forecast.\n\u201cMarkets hoped we\u2019d see a little more supportive rhetoric in terms of the policy backdrop from Kuroda,\u201d said Jeremy Stretch , head of currency strategy at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, by phone from London . \u201cWhilst he gave us some warm words, he didn\u2019t really provide us any impetus to maintaining a weaker yen bias.\u201d\nThe yen strengthened 2.8 percent to 96.03 per dollar at 5 p.m. New York time, after rising as much as 3.2 percent, the most on a closing basis since May 2010.

Europe\u2019s shared currency added 0.4 percent to $1.3313, touching the strongest level on a closing basis since Feb. 19.\nStocks, Swings\nOne-year implied volatility for the dollar-yen climbed to 12.8 percent, its highest level since September 2011. The Topix index of Japanese stocks decreased 1 percent, while the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index of stocks declined 1 percent.\nTreasuries rallied, with the 10-year note yield falling two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 2.19 percent even after the bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by comparing total bids with the amount of securities offered, was 2.95, the lowest since December 2010.\n\u201cThe three-year note auction, I guess it was pretty weak,\u201d said Eric Viloria, senior currency strategist for Gain Capital Group LLC, by phone from New York.\nJapan \u2019s Nikkei newspaper reported the Japanese FSA plans to adopt a \u201cbail-in\u201d program to prevent taxpayer-funded rescues of failing banks.\n\u201cMaybe it took just a little spark to set off the move and it was the lack of liquidity,\u201d said Brian Daingerfield,  a currency strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc\u2019s RBS Securities unit by phone from Stamford , Connecticut . \u201cDollar longs are quite large and this position clear-out still has a long way to go.\u201d A long position is a bet that an asset will increase in value.\nAussie Falls\nAustralia\u2019s dollar touched its weakest level since 2010 versus the greenback as the nation\u2019s statistics bureau said April home-loan approvals rose 0.8 percent, versus the 2 percent advance estimated by economists and a revised 4.8 percent gain in March.\nThe currency decreased 0.4 percent to 94.27 U.S. cents after reaching the lowest on a closing basis since Sept. 10, 2010.\n\u201cHousing is the one area most likely to make up for the mining investment downturn, and it\u2019s disappointed,\u201d said Joseph Capurso , a Sydney-based foreign-exchange strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia.

That compares with a 5.3 percent estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists. The jobless rate climbed to the highest in three years.\nRinggit Down\nMalaysia\u2019s ringgit weakened on speculation the Federal Reserve will cut its monetary stimulus, slowing inflows into emerging-market assets.\nThe peso fell 0.5 percent to 43.085 per dollar. Malaysia\u2019s currency depreciated 0.7 percent to 3.15 per dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

All but three of 23 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey either forecast that the BOJ would approve two-year or longer loan operations at the policy meeting or said such a move was possible.\nKuroda said after the meeting that the central bank would discuss longer fund operations when needed.\nBOJ Projections\n\u201cMost investors didn\u2019t expect any action, but a handful of players thought officials might have done something to put a lid on rising bond yields,\u201d Joe Manimbo , a market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions, a unit of Western Union Co., said in a telephone interview from Washington . \u201cSince that didn\u2019t materialize, we\u2019ve seen a sharp selloff in the Nikkei.

The contract includes a 15-year service agreement.\nSouth Africa plans to add 3,725 megawatts in renewable energy capacity by the end of 2016 through a program of five tenders to help curb its reliance on coal for electricity.

While the Madrid-based company is contemplating ways to raise the funds, including a rights offering of the local unit, the government is reluctant to dilute its 30 percent stake, he said.\n\u201cMore capital is something that this company needs or else it won\u2019t be able to compete,\u201d Fernandez Valbuena said yesterday at Bloomberg\u2019s Sao Paulo office. \u201cWe have not even decided which way to go. It depends crucially on what the government wants to accept as a process, and that\u2019s difficult.\u201d\nTelefonica is struggling to compete in Colombia against billionaire Carlos Slim \u2019s America Movil SAB, which leads Latin America\u2019s fourth-largest economy with 62 percent of mobile-phone subscribers . Telefonica also needs to cut a $1.5 billion pension-fund deficit that has to be paid off from the company\u2019s earnings, he said.\nAfter an $85 billion acquisition spree over a decade increased debt and triggered rating cuts, Telefonica Chief Executive Officer Cesar Alierta last year began selling assets. The company said last month it was in talks with Colombian government officials to assess different options to capitalize the unit after halting an initial public offering for all of its Latin American assets.\n\u2018Interesting Proposition\u2019\nColombia plans to hold an auction for faster 4G wireless service on June 26, with payments due about three months later, according to a schedule on the government\u2019s website . The plan is \u201can interesting proposition -- it\u2019s likely to be a good investment but if you don\u2019t have the cash, you\u2019re out,\u201d Fernandez Valbuena said.\nColombian Deputy Finance Minister Andres Restrepo said he had no response to Fernandez Valbuena\u2019s comments. Finance Minister Mauricio Cardenas was traveling and couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.\nTelefonica is seeking to raise \u201csubstantial\u201d funds to participate in the auction of 4G radio spectrum, Fernandez Valbuena said, adding the company doesn\u2019t have a specific amount in mind. A deal will still take months to be completed, he added.\nUnit Merger\nLast year, the Spanish phone carrier merged its Colombian units -- wholly owned wireless division Telefonica Moviles Colombia and fixed-line venture Colombia Telecomunicaciones, which was 48 percent state owned -- to cut $1.7 billion of debt. That deal left Telefonica holding 70 percent of the combined company and Colombia the remainder, with the state stake possibly increasing by as much as 3 percentage points in 2015.\nTelefonica shares were little changed at 10.20 euros at the close in Madrid , valuing the company at 46.4 billion euros ($61.9 billion). The benchmark IBEX 35 index gained 0.4 percent.\nThe pension fund is also hamstringing Telefonica in Colombia by keeping its leverage far too high, at about five times earnings, Fernandez Valbuena said. That ratio should be closer to three times, and the company needs two or three years to reduce the size of the fund, he said.\nMexico, Peru\n\u201cWe have to bring it down,\u201d he said. \u201cThe last thing we need is for them to be able to say, \u2019Oh, these guys are broke,\u2019 which we are sometimes depending on the configuration of yields and things.\u201d\nWhile Colombia represents less than 3 percent of Telefonica\u2019s revenue, the company is counting on markets in Spanish-speaking Latin America for expansion as growth slows in Brazil and European markets struggle to recover. While Colombian revenue rose 13 percent last year to 1.77 billion euros, it would have climbed 1.6 percent leaving out currency changes, trailing growth in markets including Brazil, Chile and Peru .\nIn Mexico , where Telefonica\u2019s market share is also dwarfed by America Movil\u2019s 70 percent of mobile-phone customers, Telefonica is getting help from a new law that will help boost competition, Fernandez Valbuena said.\nLaw Change\n\u201cIt\u2019s a major step forward into the 21st century, which is where Mexico belongs,\u201d he said. The law should boost revenue for all smaller competitors in the country, he said. While the law, signed yesterday by President Enrique Pena Nieto, allows foreign companies to own landline networks in Mexico for the first time, Telefonica is keeping its focus on mobile phones, Fernandez Valbuena said.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think it is such a great business today,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not high in our plans to become active in the landline market in Mexico.\u201d\nWhile Telefonica already offers home-phone services through a 49 percent stake in Grupo de Telecomunicaciones Mexicanas SA, it uses a wireless technology to do so and doesn\u2019t provide the high-speed Internet and television its competitors can through their landlines.\n\u201cThe only market where you\u2019re at a disadvantage if you don\u2019t have a landline is the corporate market, which is nice, and nice to have,\u201d Fernandez Valbuena said. \u201cBut you don\u2019t have to have a national network to serve and to cater to the corporate market.\u201d\nShelved IPO\nTelefonica shelved plans earlier this year to carry out an IPO for the company\u2019s Latin American division mainly because of valuation, Fernandez Valbuena said.\n\u201cA lot of the legal and tax work have been done, and we just put it in the freezer so we can take it out if necessary in the future,\u201d he said. He ruled out selling more shares in other stable, fast-growing markets in the region including Chile and Peru.\nIn Venezuela , Telefonica plans to boost spending to avoid sitting on cash that may lose a third of its value as speculation mounts that the government may devalue the bolivar for a second time this year, a person familiar with the matter said last week.\n\u201cThe only exchange rate that worries me is the Venezuelan bolivar because that\u2019s the one that\u2019s fully out of mind,\u201d Fernandez Valbuena said.\nOther currencies in the region may also pose a risk to Telefonica\u2019s earnings, Barclays Plc analysts said in a June 6 note. The weakness of the Brazilian real in the second quarter will hurt results for Telefonica, Telecom Italia SpA (TIT) and Portugal Telecom SGPS SA, according to the note.\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Manuel Baigorri in Madrid at mbaigorri@bloomberg.net ; Christiana Sciaudone in Sao Paulo at csciaudone@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Kenneth Wong at kwong11@bloomberg.net ; Ed Dufner at edufner@bloomberg.net\nTelefonica Grapples With Colombian Government on Raising Funds\nAngel Navarrete/Bloomberg\nA Telefonica logo sits on display outside the headquarters of Telefonica SA in Madrid.\nA Telefonica logo sits on display outside the headquarters of Telefonica SA in Madrid.

Shah Deniz, a gas deposit group led by BP Plc (BP/) , is expected by July to choose between the two projects to transport 10 billion cubic meters of gas annually to the European Union. The group\u2019s partners also include Statoil ASA (STL) , Total SA (FP) and State Oil Company of Azerbaijan, or Socar.\n\u201cOur message to Shah Deniz is that TAP is less costly as it\u2019s shorter, and that all the governments involved support it,\u201d Klisovic said in an interview in his office in Zagreb today. \u201cThis includes Italy, which is one of the biggest gas consumers in Europe.\u201d\nEU nations want to curb their reliance on gas deliveries from Russia through Ukraine after disruption in recent years over price disputes. TAP\u2019s 800-kilometer (500-mile) route would go through Turkey through Greece, and Albania to Italy, while the 1,300-kilometer Nabucco would traverse Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary.\nGas Consumption\nGas consumption in the former Yugoslav region and Albania will double by 2020 to 11 billion cubic meters of gas a year, according to an October 2011 study by state-owned pipeline operator Plinacro d.o.o.\nCroatia , which needs about 1 billion cubic meters of gas a year, wants to meet the increased demand by diversifying its supplies.\nFrom the Albanian town of Fier, an interconnector would lead toward Montenegro and further on to Croatia, joining the existing pipeline at Split and ending at the island of Krk in the northern Adriatic, where Croatia plans to build a liquefied natural-gas terminal, Klisovic said. An off-shoot pipeline to Hungary is also planned, he said.\n\u201cCroatia supports the TAP project as it gives us the possibility to diversify our gas supply,\u201d Klisovic said. Diversification plans \u201cprobably\u201d include a connector to the South Stream gas pipeline project, whose main stakeholder is Russia\u2019s Gazprom OAO (GAZP) , as well as the building of an LNG terminal on Krk, he said.\nTerminal Studies\nPre-feasibility and environment studies for the terminal, estimated at 700 million euros ($929 million) are completed, and the government will proceed with seeking strategic partners in the fall, Klisovic said.\nThe OMV AG-led Nabucco pipeline project said it can offer bigger markets and greater potential for exports should it win the right to ship natural gas from Azerbaijan\u2019s Shah Deniz field to Europe over a rival proposal, Christian Dolezal, communications chief of Nabucco Gas Pipeline International GmbH, said in March.\nAzerbaijan said in February it favors TAP. Nabucco offered in January a 50 percent equity option in the pipeline to the Shah Deniz group.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Jasmina Kuzmanovic at jkuzmanovic@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James M.

In May, company officials said they expected to make some asset disposals before the summer.\nFCC, which reported a first-quarter net loss of 140.2 million euros compared with profit of 16.6 million euros a year ago, rose as much as 4.1 percent in Madrid trading while Veolia declined as much as 1 percent in Paris.\nVeolia already held half of Proactiva, which reported sales of about 540 million euros last year, according to the statement.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Manuel Baigorri in Madrid  at mbaigorri@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Randall Hackley at rhackley@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "postDate": "2013-06-10T12:26:57", "author": "", "title": "FCC Sells Proactiva Stake to Veolia for 150 Million Euros"}, {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-12/banco-bilbao-to-stop-applying-mortgage-floors-hitting-profits.html", "content": "Banco Bilbao Says Profit to Be Hit by End of Mortgage \u2018Floors\u2019\nBy Charles Penty - 2013-06-12T22:01:00Z\nBanco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) , Spain\u2019s second-biggest bank, said it would stop applying so-called \u201cfloors,\u201d or clauses setting minimum interest rates, on its mortgages after a court ruling.\nSpain\u2019s Supreme Court made it clear yesterday that floor clauses that don\u2019t meet transparency requirements are considered null, and that rule applies to BBVA\u2019s mortgage contracts, the Bilbao, Spain-based lender said in a regulatory filing. The change implies a drop in profit for BBVA for June of 35 million euros ($46.7 million) and its future impact will depend on the evolution of the Euribor interest benchmark used for mortgages, the bank said.\n\u201cIn accordance to the decision of the Supreme Court, BBVA will cease to apply such floor clauses to consumer mortgage loans, with effect from May 9, 2013, although it reserves its right to possible appeals,\u201d the bank said in its statement yesterday.\nSpanish banks including BBVA have relied on interest-rate floors written into mortgage contracts to shield them from the plunge in revenue caused by the decline in the Euribor. The benchmark is used as a reference for most of Spain\u2019s 600 billion euros of mortgages. One-year Euribor reached 0.484 percent in May, down from more than 5 percent in 2008.\nIn a 2010 report on mortgage floors, the Bank of Spain found that out of 49 lenders, 16 applied them on more than 85 percent of their loans, while 23 used them barely or not at all. The average floor level was 3.12 percent.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Charles Penty in Madrid at cpenty@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Frank Connelly at fconnelly@bloomberg.net\n", "postDate": "2013-06-12T22:01:00", "author": "", "title": "Banco Bilbao Says Profit to Be Hit by End of Mortgage \u2018Floors\u2019"}, {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-10/chile-home-prices-to-slow-from-last-year-paz-ceo-magendzo-says.html", "content": "Chile Home Prices to Slow From Last Year, Paz CEO Magendzo Says\nBy Eduardo Thomson - 2013-06-10T20:50:35Z\nIncreases in Chilean home prices will fall short of last year\u2019s record growth amid a tempered economic outlook, Paz Corp SA (PAZ) Chief Executive Officer Ariel Magendzo said in an interview.\n\u201cEconomic expectations are starting to moderate, and that may make people less anxious to rush out and buy a house,\u201d Magendzo said in an interview in his office in Santiago.\nPaz, Chile\u2019s second-largest publicly traded homebuilder, has tumbled 15 percent this year after rising 69 percent in 2012.

In March, annual price growth slowed to 6.5 percent, based on the chamber\u2019s latest monthly reading.\nChile \u2019s economy expanded by 4.1 percent in the first quarter from the year earlier, the slowest pace since the three months through September 2011.

The currency extended gains versus the dollar as Treasuries rallied even after demand slumped at a Treasury auction of three-year notes. Australia \u2019s dollar dropped to an almost three-year low after data showed home-loan approvals expanded by less than economists forecast.\n\u201cMarkets hoped we\u2019d see a little more supportive rhetoric in terms of the policy backdrop from Kuroda,\u201d said Jeremy Stretch , head of currency strategy at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, by phone from London . \u201cWhilst he gave us some warm words, he didn\u2019t really provide us any impetus to maintaining a weaker yen bias.\u201d\nThe yen strengthened 2.8 percent to 96.03 per dollar at 5 p.m. New York time, after rising as much as 3.2 percent, the most on a closing basis since May 2010. It gained 2.4 percent to 127.84 per euro. Europe\u2019s shared currency added 0.4 percent to $1.3313, touching the strongest level on a closing basis since Feb. 19.\nStocks, Swings\nOne-year implied volatility for the dollar-yen climbed to 12.8 percent, its highest level since September 2011. The Topix index of Japanese stocks decreased 1 percent, while the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index of stocks declined 1 percent.\nTreasuries rallied, with the 10-year note yield falling two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 2.19 percent even after the bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by comparing total bids with the amount of securities offered, was 2.95, the lowest since December 2010.\n\u201cThe three-year note auction, I guess it was pretty weak,\u201d said Eric Viloria, senior currency strategist for Gain Capital Group LLC, by phone from New York.\nJapan \u2019s Nikkei newspaper reported the Japanese FSA plans to adopt a \u201cbail-in\u201d program to prevent taxpayer-funded rescues of failing banks.\n\u201cMaybe it took just a little spark to set off the move and it was the lack of liquidity,\u201d said Brian Daingerfield,  a currency strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc\u2019s RBS Securities unit by phone from Stamford , Connecticut . \u201cDollar longs are quite large and this position clear-out still has a long way to go.\u201d A long position is a bet that an asset will increase in value.\nAussie Falls\nAustralia\u2019s dollar touched its weakest level since 2010 versus the greenback as the nation\u2019s statistics bureau said April home-loan approvals rose 0.8 percent, versus the 2 percent advance estimated by economists and a revised 4.8 percent gain in March.\nThe currency decreased 0.4 percent to 94.27 U.S. cents after reaching the lowest on a closing basis since Sept. 10, 2010.\n\u201cHousing is the one area most likely to make up for the mining investment downturn, and it\u2019s disappointed,\u201d said Joseph Capurso , a Sydney-based foreign-exchange strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia. (CBA) \u201cYou\u2019ve got to say that the Aussie\u2019s going to keep on falling.\u201d\nThe Philippine peso fell for a fifth day against the dollar after official figures showed overseas shipments from the Philippines slipped 12.8 percent in April. That compares with a 5.3 percent estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists. The jobless rate climbed to the highest in three years.\nRinggit Down\nMalaysia\u2019s ringgit weakened on speculation the Federal Reserve will cut its monetary stimulus, slowing inflows into emerging-market assets.\nThe peso fell 0.5 percent to 43.085 per dollar. Malaysia\u2019s currency depreciated 0.7 percent to 3.15 per dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 3.1615, the weakest level since July 27.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s G-7 Volatility Index, based on currency option premiums, reached 10.57 percent. It touched 10.62 percent on June 7, the highest level since June 2012. Yields Italy\u2019s 10-year government securities rose eight basis points to 4.37 percent, while Spanish 10-year yields added six basis points to 4.66 percent.\nThe BOJ kept unchanged its plan for a 60 trillion-yen to 70 trillion-yen annual increase in monetary base, the central bank said after a two-day meeting ended today. All but three of 23 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey either forecast that the BOJ would approve two-year or longer loan operations at the policy meeting or said such a move was possible.\nKuroda said after the meeting that the central bank would discuss longer fund operations when needed.\nBOJ Projections\n\u201cMost investors didn\u2019t expect any action, but a handful of players thought officials might have done something to put a lid on rising bond yields,\u201d Joe Manimbo , a market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions, a unit of Western Union Co., said in a telephone interview from Washington . \u201cSince that didn\u2019t materialize, we\u2019ve seen a sharp selloff in the Nikkei. They didn\u2019t do much to instill optimism that Japan is leaning towards more action to settle markets.\u201d\nThe yield on Japan\u2019s benchmark 10-year bond climbed five basis points to 0.89 percent. It has swung from an all-time low of 0.315 percent to as much as 1 percent since the BOJ announced in April a plan to double monthly bond purchases to more than 7 trillion yen.\nThe yen has climbed 6.2 percent in the past month, the best performer among 10 developed-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.

The sale is subject to market conditions, the bank said. Banorte shares plunged 4.3 percent to 78.07 pesos at the close of trading in Mexico City, leading the benchmark IPC index to a 1 percent drop.\n\u201cThe stock will remain under pressure in the short-term\u201d as investors brace for the additional supply from the sale, Aldo Miranda, a trader with Intercam Casa de Bolsa SA, said in a telephone interview from Mexico City. \u201cIn the long-term, I like the growth story. There\u2019s strong appetite for financial industry stocks.\u201d\nThe offering adds to a record pace for equity issuance in Latin America\u2019s second-biggest market. Last year, Banco Santander SA\u2019s Mexico unit raised $4.1 billion through a share sale as investors sought exposure to an economy the government says could grow 6 percent after a series of planned policy overhauls, including opening the energy industry to increased private investment.\n\u2018Very Attractive\u2019\nThe $3 billion transaction represents about a fifth of the company\u2019s 181.6 billion peso ($14 billion) market capitalization.\nThe offering will include new equity issued through the Mexican stock exchange and a private sale abroad, according to the statement.\nBanorte said yesterday it agreed to buy stakes in Seguros Banorte Generali and Pensiones Banorte Generali for $857.5 million from Assicurazioni Generali SpA. (G)\nThe bank borrowed $800 million earlier this year from a group of lenders including Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. to help finance its purchase of a stake in Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) \u2019s pension fund unit. Mexico City-based Banorte and Mexico\u2019s Social Security Institute, known as IMSS, each agreed last year to pay half of the $1.6 billion price tag for the Afore Bancomer pension fund.\nAyax Carranza, a press official with Banorte, declined to comment on how the bank plans to use of the proceeds.\nThe lender was considering a sale of about $2 billion worth of shares earlier in the year, people with direct knowledge of the situation said April 5, asking not be named because the details were still private.\nAndres Audiffred, an analyst with Grupo Financiero Ve Por Mas SA who recommends buying the stock, wrote in a report today that the selloff triggered by the sale plans has been overdone and made the current share price \u201cvery attractive.\u201d\nBanorte has fallen 21 percent from a record high reached on March 14.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Jonathan Levin in Mexico City at jlevin20@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: David Papadopoulos at papadopoulos@bloomberg.net\nBanorte Seeks $3 Billion in Sequel to Record Santander Sale\nSusana Gonzalez/Bloomberg\nPedestrians pass by a Banorte branch in Mexico City on Feb. 27, 2013.\nPedestrians pass by a Banorte branch in Mexico City on Feb. 27, 2013.

While the Madrid-based company is contemplating ways to raise the funds, including a rights offering of the local unit, the government is reluctant to dilute its 30 percent stake, he said.\n\u201cMore capital is something that this company needs or else it won\u2019t be able to compete,\u201d Fernandez Valbuena said yesterday at Bloomberg\u2019s Sao Paulo office. \u201cWe have not even decided which way to go. It depends crucially on what the government wants to accept as a process, and that\u2019s difficult.\u201d\nTelefonica is struggling to compete in Colombia against billionaire Carlos Slim \u2019s America Movil SAB, which leads Latin America\u2019s fourth-largest economy with 62 percent of mobile-phone subscribers . Telefonica also needs to cut a $1.5 billion pension-fund deficit that has to be paid off from the company\u2019s earnings, he said.\nAfter an $85 billion acquisition spree over a decade increased debt and triggered rating cuts, Telefonica Chief Executive Officer Cesar Alierta last year began selling assets. The company said last month it was in talks with Colombian government officials to assess different options to capitalize the unit after halting an initial public offering for all of its Latin American assets.\n\u2018Interesting Proposition\u2019\nColombia plans to hold an auction for faster 4G wireless service on June 26, with payments due about three months later, according to a schedule on the government\u2019s website . The plan is \u201can interesting proposition -- it\u2019s likely to be a good investment but if you don\u2019t have the cash, you\u2019re out,\u201d Fernandez Valbuena said.\nColombian Deputy Finance Minister Andres Restrepo said he had no response to Fernandez Valbuena\u2019s comments. Finance Minister Mauricio Cardenas was traveling and couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.\nTelefonica is seeking to raise \u201csubstantial\u201d funds to participate in the auction of 4G radio spectrum, Fernandez Valbuena said, adding the company doesn\u2019t have a specific amount in mind. A deal will still take months to be completed, he added.\nUnit Merger\nLast year, the Spanish phone carrier merged its Colombian units -- wholly owned wireless division Telefonica Moviles Colombia and fixed-line venture Colombia Telecomunicaciones, which was 48 percent state owned -- to cut $1.7 billion of debt. That deal left Telefonica holding 70 percent of the combined company and Colombia the remainder, with the state stake possibly increasing by as much as 3 percentage points in 2015.\nTelefonica shares were little changed at 10.20 euros at the close in Madrid , valuing the company at 46.4 billion euros ($61.9 billion). The benchmark IBEX 35 index gained 0.4 percent.\nThe pension fund is also hamstringing Telefonica in Colombia by keeping its leverage far too high, at about five times earnings, Fernandez Valbuena said. That ratio should be closer to three times, and the company needs two or three years to reduce the size of the fund, he said.\nMexico, Peru\n\u201cWe have to bring it down,\u201d he said. \u201cThe last thing we need is for them to be able to say, \u2019Oh, these guys are broke,\u2019 which we are sometimes depending on the configuration of yields and things.\u201d\nWhile Colombia represents less than 3 percent of Telefonica\u2019s revenue, the company is counting on markets in Spanish-speaking Latin America for expansion as growth slows in Brazil and European markets struggle to recover. While Colombian revenue rose 13 percent last year to 1.77 billion euros, it would have climbed 1.6 percent leaving out currency changes, trailing growth in markets including Brazil, Chile and Peru .\nIn Mexico , where Telefonica\u2019s market share is also dwarfed by America Movil\u2019s 70 percent of mobile-phone customers, Telefonica is getting help from a new law that will help boost competition, Fernandez Valbuena said.\nLaw Change\n\u201cIt\u2019s a major step forward into the 21st century, which is where Mexico belongs,\u201d he said. The law should boost revenue for all smaller competitors in the country, he said. While the law, signed yesterday by President Enrique Pena Nieto, allows foreign companies to own landline networks in Mexico for the first time, Telefonica is keeping its focus on mobile phones, Fernandez Valbuena said.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think it is such a great business today,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not high in our plans to become active in the landline market in Mexico.\u201d\nWhile Telefonica already offers home-phone services through a 49 percent stake in Grupo de Telecomunicaciones Mexicanas SA, it uses a wireless technology to do so and doesn\u2019t provide the high-speed Internet and television its competitors can through their landlines.\n\u201cThe only market where you\u2019re at a disadvantage if you don\u2019t have a landline is the corporate market, which is nice, and nice to have,\u201d Fernandez Valbuena said. \u201cBut you don\u2019t have to have a national network to serve and to cater to the corporate market.\u201d\nShelved IPO\nTelefonica shelved plans earlier this year to carry out an IPO for the company\u2019s Latin American division mainly because of valuation, Fernandez Valbuena said.\n\u201cA lot of the legal and tax work have been done, and we just put it in the freezer so we can take it out if necessary in the future,\u201d he said. He ruled out selling more shares in other stable, fast-growing markets in the region including Chile and Peru.\nIn Venezuela , Telefonica plans to boost spending to avoid sitting on cash that may lose a third of its value as speculation mounts that the government may devalue the bolivar for a second time this year, a person familiar with the matter said last week.\n\u201cThe only exchange rate that worries me is the Venezuelan bolivar because that\u2019s the one that\u2019s fully out of mind,\u201d Fernandez Valbuena said.\nOther currencies in the region may also pose a risk to Telefonica\u2019s earnings, Barclays Plc analysts said in a June 6 note. The weakness of the Brazilian real in the second quarter will hurt results for Telefonica, Telecom Italia SpA (TIT) and Portugal Telecom SGPS SA, according to the note.\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Manuel Baigorri in Madrid at mbaigorri@bloomberg.net ; Christiana Sciaudone in Sao Paulo at csciaudone@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Kenneth Wong at kwong11@bloomberg.net ; Ed Dufner at edufner@bloomberg.net\nTelefonica Grapples With Colombian Government on Raising Funds\nAngel Navarrete/Bloomberg\nA Telefonica logo sits on display outside the headquarters of Telefonica SA in Madrid.\nA Telefonica logo sits on display outside the headquarters of Telefonica SA in Madrid.

The change implies a drop in profit for BBVA for June of 35 million euros ($46.7 million) and its future impact will depend on the evolution of the Euribor interest benchmark used for mortgages, the bank said.\n\u201cIn accordance to the decision of the Supreme Court, BBVA will cease to apply such floor clauses to consumer mortgage loans, with effect from May 9, 2013, although it reserves its right to possible appeals,\u201d the bank said in its statement yesterday.\nSpanish banks including BBVA have relied on interest-rate floors written into mortgage contracts to shield them from the plunge in revenue caused by the decline in the Euribor. The benchmark is used as a reference for most of Spain\u2019s 600 billion euros of mortgages. One-year Euribor reached 0.484 percent in May, down from more than 5 percent in 2008.\nIn a 2010 report on mortgage floors, the Bank of Spain found that out of 49 lenders, 16 applied them on more than 85 percent of their loans, while 23 used them barely or not at all. The average floor level was 3.12 percent.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Charles Penty in Madrid at cpenty@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Frank Connelly at fconnelly@bloomberg.net\n", "postDate": "2013-06-12T22:01:00", "author": "", "title": "Banco Bilbao Says Profit to Be Hit by End of Mortgage \u2018Floors\u2019"}, {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-11/malaysia-s-tenaga-said-to-plan-bid-for-ireland-s-bord-gais-unit.html", "content": "Malaysia\u2019s Tenaga Said to Plan Bid for Ireland\u2019s Bord Gais Unit\nBy Joe Brennan & Elffie Chew - 2013-06-11T08:00:34Z\nTenaga Nasional Bhd (TNB) , Malaysia \u2019s largest power group, is considering a bid for the retail and power generation unit of Irish state-owned gas company Bord Gais Eireann, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.\nA successful offer would mark the Kuala Lumpur-based company\u2019s initial foray into the European utilities market, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified, as the talks are private.

Shah Deniz, a gas deposit group led by BP Plc (BP/) , is expected by July to choose between the two projects to transport 10 billion cubic meters of gas annually to the European Union. The group\u2019s partners also include Statoil ASA (STL) , Total SA (FP) and State Oil Company of Azerbaijan, or Socar.\n\u201cOur message to Shah Deniz is that TAP is less costly as it\u2019s shorter, and that all the governments involved support it,\u201d Klisovic said in an interview in his office in Zagreb today. \u201cThis includes Italy, which is one of the biggest gas consumers in Europe.\u201d\nEU nations want to curb their reliance on gas deliveries from Russia through Ukraine after disruption in recent years over price disputes. TAP\u2019s 800-kilometer (500-mile) route would go through Turkey through Greece, and Albania to Italy, while the 1,300-kilometer Nabucco would traverse Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary.\nGas Consumption\nGas consumption in the former Yugoslav region and Albania will double by 2020 to 11 billion cubic meters of gas a year, according to an October 2011 study by state-owned pipeline operator Plinacro d.o.o.\nCroatia , which needs about 1 billion cubic meters of gas a year, wants to meet the increased demand by diversifying its supplies.\nFrom the Albanian town of Fier, an interconnector would lead toward Montenegro and further on to Croatia, joining the existing pipeline at Split and ending at the island of Krk in the northern Adriatic, where Croatia plans to build a liquefied natural-gas terminal, Klisovic said. An off-shoot pipeline to Hungary is also planned, he said.\n\u201cCroatia supports the TAP project as it gives us the possibility to diversify our gas supply,\u201d Klisovic said. Diversification plans \u201cprobably\u201d include a connector to the South Stream gas pipeline project, whose main stakeholder is Russia\u2019s Gazprom OAO (GAZP) , as well as the building of an LNG terminal on Krk, he said.\nTerminal Studies\nPre-feasibility and environment studies for the terminal, estimated at 700 million euros ($929 million) are completed, and the government will proceed with seeking strategic partners in the fall, Klisovic said.\nThe OMV AG-led Nabucco pipeline project said it can offer bigger markets and greater potential for exports should it win the right to ship natural gas from Azerbaijan\u2019s Shah Deniz field to Europe over a rival proposal, Christian Dolezal, communications chief of Nabucco Gas Pipeline International GmbH, said in March.\nAzerbaijan said in February it favors TAP.

Treasuries dropped and natural gas rebounded.\nThe Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index (SPX) closed 0.8 percent higher at 1,639.04 in New York, trimming an earlier advance of as much as 1.2 percent. Futures on the Nikkei 225 Stock Average were little changed, after the index jumped 2.7 percent yesterday, while contracts on Hong Kong \u2019s Hang Seng Index added 0.4 percent. S&P/ASX 200 futures expiring this month gained 0.2 percent. Japan \u2019s currency depreciated against 14 of 16 major peers after surging versus the dollar last week. Yields on 10-year Treasuries rose five basis points to 2.18 percent.\nWith the Federal Open Market Committee starting its two-day policy meeting today, data in the U.S. showed manufacturing in the New York area climbed to the highest level since March this month and U.S. homebuilder confidence soared to a seven-year high. The MSCI All-Country World Index gained 0.9 percent yesterday as a British official said Group of Eight leaders see downside risks to the global economy abating even as growth prospects remain weak.\n\u201cWe continue to have these momentary scares around what the next step for the Fed might be, which seems to send some chills up the spine of the market, but that\u2019s a little overdone,\u201d James Dunigan, who helps oversee $112 billion as chief investment officer in Philadelphia for PNC Wealth Management, said by phone. \u201cWe\u2019re ahead of ourselves with regard to the Fed acting anytime soon in reducing the support that it\u2019s providing for the economy.\u201d\nAnticipating Bernanke\nAbout $2.7 trillion has been erased from the value of global equities since Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said May 22 that U.S. policy makers \u201ccould\u201d scale back stimulus efforts should the employment outlook show \u201csustainable improvement.\u201d Stocks retreated from earlier highs today after the Financial Times reported that Bernanke may signal the central bank is close to tapering its $85 billion in monthly asset purchases.\nThe S&P 500 fell 0.6 percent June 14, and slid 1 percent last week, after the International Monetary Fund cut its forecast for U.S. economic growth in 2014 to 2.7 percent from 3 percent and said any trimming of Fed support needs to be handled properly. The benchmark equity gauge rallied an average 16 percent over two years the last four times the Fed started raising interest rates , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\u201cIf the Fed does decide to remove some if its support, the truth of the matter is, historically, equity markets can survive in a rising rates environment,\u201d Alan Gayle , a senior strategist at RidgeWorth Capital management in Richmond, Virginia, which oversees about $48 billion of assets, said in a phone interview.\nWorst Passed\nLeaders of the G-8 nations say the worst has passed for the global economy, an aide to U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron said after summit talks on promoting employment and growth. While economic prospects remain weak, risks of weakness have eased due to actions taken by policy makers in the U.S., euro area and Japan, and to the resilience of emerging-market economies, the aide said, following the meeting in Enniskillen, Northern Ireland.\nThe yen weakened 0.2 percent to 94.65 per dollar by 6:24 a.m. in Tokyo , after slipping 0.2 percent to 94.51 yesterday. The currency depreciated 0.1 percent to 126.49 per euro. The Australian dollar was little changed at 95.53 U.S. cents before the release of the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s June policy meeting minutes, when the regulator kept the cash rate target at 2.75 percent. U.S.Treasuries declined for the first time in three days.\nU.S. Homebuilding\nInvestors have been monitoring U.S. economic reports to determine whether growth is strong enough to prompt the Fed to scale back stimulus measures. The Fed Bank of New York\u2019s general economic index climbed to 7.8, a report yesterday showed. Readings of greater than zero signal expansion in New York, northern New Jersey and southern Connecticut . The median projection in a Bloomberg survey of 51 economists called for a reading of zero.\nConfidence among U.S. homebuilders surged in June to the highest level in seven years, reflecting gains in sales as Americans rushed to take advantage of low mortgage rates . An S&P index of homebuilders jumped 2 percent, with PulteGroup Inc. and Toll Brothers Inc. advancing more than 2.4 percent.\nNine of 10 groups in the S&P 500 advanced, with energy and technology stocks rising the most.\nThe Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, or VIX (VIX) , fell 2 percent to 16.80. The equity volatility gauge, which moves in the opposite direction as the S&P 500 about 80 percent of the time, reached a six-year low in March and has since surged 49 percent.\nGas Gains\nThe Stoxx Europe 600 Index climbed 0.7 percent after posting four straight weeks of losses, with trading volume 20 percent less than the 30-day average. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index rose 0.4 percent.\nNatural gas climbed, capping the biggest gain in seven weeks, on forecasts for hotter weather in late June that would spur demand from power plants . Futures for July delivery rose 3.8 percent to $3.875 per million British thermal units.\nCrude oil fluctuated near a nine-month high, settling at $97.77 a barrel in New York, down 0.1 percent. The price climbed as much as 0.9 percent, the most since Sept. 14.\nSoybeans declined for the fourth straight session in the U.S., capping the longest slump in seven weeks, as drier conditions in the U.S. accelerated planting and boosted crop development. Futures slid 1 percent to close at $12.855 a bushel. Corn rebounded, reversing an early decline.\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Inyoung Hwang in New York at ihwang7@bloomberg.net ; Katie Brennan in New York at kbrennan23@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Lynn Thomasson at lthomasson@bloomberg.net ; Emma O\u2019Brien at eobrien6@bloomberg.net\nEuro Stock Futures Rise With Asia Shares as Yen, Corn Decline\nYuriko Nakao/Bloomberg\nJapanese 10,000 yen banknotes and U.S. one-hundred dollar banknotes are arranged for a photograph in Tokyo, Japan.\nJapanese 10,000 yen banknotes and U.S. one-hundred dollar banknotes are arranged for a photograph in Tokyo, Japan.

Its proposal to introduce a criminal offence for mismanagement, which could see executives of failed firms facing jail time, was endorsed by Prime Minister David Cameron .\n\u201cThe potential rewards for fleeting short-term success have sometimes been huge, but the penalties for failure, often manifest only later, have been much smaller or negligible,\u201d the authors of the report said. \u201cBanks should understand that many consider the levels of reward in recent years to have grown to grotesque levels at the most senior ranks.\u201d\nPay reform is part of a program of sweeping change proposed by the commission, a cross-party group of lawmakers set up last year by Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne after a series of scandals and five years of poor returns for the financial industry. The report also called on the government to introduce a register for bankers and consider breaking up Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc .\nEU Clash\nWhile some lawyers today criticized the potential criminal offense as unworkable in practice, Andrew Tyrie , the lawmaker who leads the committee, said the proposals are better than the plan adopted this year by the European Union over U.K. resistance. The EU aims to block banker bonuses of more than double fixed pay.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to stop people earning a lot of money, but making sure that they\u2019ve demonstrated that they\u2019ve really earned it,\u201d Tyrie, a member of Cameron\u2019s Conservative Party , said in an interview this morning on BBC Radio 4. \u201cTrust in banking has collapsed. We\u2019ve got to restore it, not least because banking is essential for the British economy and the British economic revival as a whole.\u201d\nThe committee didn\u2019t call for a bonus cap because there\u2019s evidence the EU plan is having a \u201cperverse effect\u201d and pushing up fixed pay, he said.\n\u201cPenalizing, including criminal penalties against bankers who behave irresponsibly, I say yes,\u201d Cameron told lawmakers in the House of Commons in London today. On the question of clawing back bonuses, \u201cI say yes too,\u201d Cameron said.\nMansion House\nThe government welcomes the report and plans to respond by the summer Parliamentary recess, a Treasury spokesman said in an e-mailed statement. Jean-Christophe Gray, a spokesman for Cameron, told reporters in London today that the commission\u2019s report was \u201can impressive piece of work.\u201d\n\u201cThe right thing to do is consider it in detail but consider it very swiftly as well,\u201d Gray said.\nOsborne will address senior financial figures on the recommendations and the future of state-controlled RBS and Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) in his speech at London\u2019s Mansion House later today. He has sought to simultaneously defend London\u2019s financial district from EU restraints, placate British voters and retain well-paid jobs amid speculation banks may be tempted to relocate some of their operations to New York , Hong Kong or Singapore for a lower tax and regulatory burden.\nDeferred Compensation\n\u201cThis is the most significant report into banking for a generation,\u201d British Bankers\u2019 Association Chief Executive Officer Anthony Browne said in an e-mailed statement. \u201cWe want the U.K.\u2019s banking industry to once again set the gold standard for professionalism and integrity. We look forward to working with government and regulators to take forward the constructive proposals contained in the report.\u201d\nBank shares fell in London trading today. HSBC declined 1.5 percent at 12:12 p.m. local time, Lloyds and Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) both fell 0.7 percent, and RBS declined 1.2 percent. Barclays dropped 0.4 percent.\nCompensation should be deferred by up to 10 years to reflect the length of time it takes for profits and losses from banking transactions to be realized, the U.K. committee said. Banks should also be given the right to claw back pay after employees leave a firm, as wrongdoing can take several years to come to light, they said.\n\u2018Pincer Movement\u2019\n\u201cBanking pay now feels as if it is caught in a pincer movement, with political and regulatory pressure suddenly now both addressing the same issues at the same time,\u201d said Isabel Pooley , a lawyer at CMS Cameron McKenna LLP. \u201cThe 10-year deferral proposal is realistically just the start of further pay restrictions. Clawbacks of bonuses which have already been paid to employees can be difficult, including recovery of any tax already paid, so firms generally prefer to reduce unvested awards instead.\u201d\nThe proposals go further than changes introduced by U.K. regulators after the financial crisis, which forced bankers to wait up to five years to get their bonuses.\n\u201cDeferral has a role to play in creating more sustainable pay practices, but too much focus on deferral is misguided,\u201d said Tom Gosling, the head of the reward practice in London at consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. \u201cIt\u2019s more important to focus on what people are getting paid for than how they are getting paid. With less deferral, it\u2019s possible to pay people less in the first place.\u201d\nPayment in Bonds\nOther suggestions by the commission include paying staff in bail-in bonds that convert into capital to absorb losses, leaving managers exposed to losses if their firm goes bust. Performance should be assessed using a range of measures rather than just return on equity, which creates \u201cperverse incentives,\u201d the committee said.\nUnite, a labor union that represents 1.5 million workers in Britain and Ireland, said the proposals aren\u2019t sufficient.\n\u201cTinkering at the edges is not enough,\u201d the union said in an e-mailed statement. \u201cThe difference between the pay of the highest and lowest paid in Britain\u2019s biggest banks is completely unacceptable.\u201d\nOver more than 600 pages of recommendations, Tyrie and his committee said a culture of greed and short-termism opened the door to mis-selling and market manipulation scandals and created a deep rift between bankers and the rest of the population.\nPrison Threat\n\u201cThe public are customers of the banks,\u201d the committee said. \u201cTaxpayers have bailed out the banks. The public have the sense that advantage has been taken of them, that bankers have received huge rewards, that some of those rewards have not been properly earned, and in some cases have been obtained through dishonesty, and that these huge rewards are excessive, bearing little or no relationship to the value of the work done.\u201d\nThe committee recommended introducing an offence for \u201creckless misconduct\u201d and potential prison time for bankers found responsible for the worst mismanagement, the first such sanctions.

The pressing question today is whether this is a significant step towards U.S.-style enforcement.\u201d\nBanker Registry\nThe authors said they would like to see a register of senior bankers whose roles and responsibilities are clearly defined to avoid situations where executives claimed to have no knowledge of deals and decisions in their banks or said they were group decisions, thus avoiding blame for losses.\n\u201cOne of the most dismal features of the banking industry to emerge from our evidence was the striking limitation on the sense of personal responsibility and accountability of the leaders within the industry for the widespread failings and abuses over which they presided,\u201d said the report. \u201cIgnorance was offered as the main excuse.\u201d\nThe commission also asked the government to carry out a \u201cdetailed analysis\u201d by September of the merits of hiving off the \u201cbad bank\u201d troubled assets of RBS, which is 81 percent government-owned.

It said lenders underestimated assets weighted for risk by 170 billion pounds, leading to a 12 billion-pound capital shortfall in that category.\nEight Banks\nThe PRA \u201cwill publish details on 20 June setting out the final conclusions of its capital exercise for all of the eight major UK banks and building societies,\u201d the central bank said in an e-mailed statement on June 17. The lenders also include Standard Chartered Plc, Nationwide Building Society and Banco Santander SA (SAN) \u2019s U.K. unit, according to the person, who requested anonymity because the details haven\u2019t been made public.\n\u201cWe would expect that Lloyds and RBS would likely be most at risk here due to having the highest proportion of U.K. commercial real estate and Ireland exposures, but there could also be material deductions for Barclays if a cautious view was taken on Spain and Italy exposures,\u201d a Morgan Stanley analyst team led by Huw Van Steenis said in a research note in March.\nCapital Estimates\nThe Morgan Stanley report estimated that Lloyds needed 7 billion pounds, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc needed 9.8 billion pounds and that Barclays has a capital shortfall of 9.1 billion pounds under the central bank\u2019s measures.\nLloyds and RBS said they could meet the requirements without needing to raise additional equity or sell contingent convertible securities, known as CoCos, which convert to equity automatically should capital levels deteriorate to a predetermined level.\nThe BOE will seek to avoid comparisons with European Union stress tests in 2010 and 2011, which were criticized for being too soft and for failing to reveal weaknesses in the 27-nation bloc\u2019s banks.\nIn 2010, the now-defunct Committee of European Banking Supervisors said that seven EU banks needed only 3.5 billion euros ($4.7 billion) more capital, a 10th of the lowest analyst estimate. Nomura Holdings Inc. said European banks would need to raise 30 billion euros, while Barclays\u2019s investment banking unit said they\u2019d need as much as 85 billion euros.\n\u2018World Changed?\u2019\n\u201cSome people were asking, \u2018have you really made them do anything?

Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) has said it already meets requirements.\nThe BOE has a \u201cmiddle course to pick\u201d between calming markets and appearing tough on banks\u2019 capital positions, Penn said.\nThe BOE has already revealed that the Co-Operative Bank Plc needs to raise 1.5 billion pounds in common equity capital \u201cin order to absorb potential losses over coming years,\u201d according to a statement on the central bank\u2019s website June 17. \u201cWe will hold the Co-Operative to the delivery of its plans.\u201d\nThe lender, which has abandoned a bid to buy branches from Lloyds, said it will swap some debt for equity and trade on the London Stock Exchange to plug the capital hole.

The derivatives pay the buyer face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements.\nTelefonica\u2019s 750 million-euro 2.736 percent bonds rose 0.2 cents on the euro to 97.6 cents at 10:10 a.m. in Spain.\nIf reports of AT&T\u2019s approach for Telefonica are true, it implies AT&T is more interested in emerging-markets exposure, rather than just cheap valuations, Robin Bienenstock , an analyst at Sanford C.

Members include MillerCoors LLC and Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (ABI) \u2019s Anheuser-Busch unit, according to the organization\u2019s website .\nThe beermakers join LME users including industrial copper companies in complaining about long waits for metal in warehouses monitored by the exchange. While the LME tried to quell those concerns by raising load-out rates, analysts such as Duncan Hobbs of Macquarie Group Ltd. said the new rules won\u2019t improve access to metals at locations with the biggest backlogs.\n\u201cWe want the LME to end restrictive load-out practices that create supply-chain bottlenecks,\u201d which have \u201cled to a complete disconnect between LME aluminum prices and actual aluminum prices and prevent brewers and their suppliers from obtaining aluminum in a reasonable timeframe at fair-market prices,\u201d the Beer Institute said in the statement.\nLoad-out is the rate at which aluminum supplies leave warehouses.\n\u201cThe LME shares the market\u2019s concerns and have brought in a series of measures to relieve the situation,\u201d Chris Evans , a spokesman for the LME, said\u00a0by e-mail today. \u201cWe continue to monitor the situation and will act again if it is in the market\u2019s best interests.\u201d He said the exchange can\u2019t comment on possible complaints.\nWarehouse queues for aluminum have grown as more metal gets tied up in financing deals that typically involve a simultaneous purchase of metal for delivery in the near future and a sale for later delivery that takes advantage of a market in contango, where prices rise into the future.\nThe premium buyers pay to obtain aluminum in the U.S. climbed to a record 12 cents to 13 cents a pound this week, according to Austin, Texas-based researcher Harbor Intelligence .\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Joe Richter in New York at jrichter1@bloomberg.net ; Agnieszka Troszkiewicz in London at atroszkiewic@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Steve Stroth at sstroth@bloomberg.net\nBeer Companies Press LME to Cut Aluminum Warehouse Backlogs\nChris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg\nWarehouse queues for aluminum have grown as more metal gets tied up in financing deals that typically involve a simultaneous purchase of metal for delivery in the near future and a sale for later delivery that takes advantage of a market in contango, where prices rise into the future.\nWarehouse queues for aluminum have grown as more metal gets tied up in financing deals that typically involve a simultaneous purchase of metal for delivery in the near future and a sale for later delivery that takes advantage of a market in contango, where prices rise into the future.

Violence later erupted with police battling mobs trying to storm the Foreign Ministry in Brasilia and Rio de Janeiro \u2019s city hall.\nIn the northern city of Belem, a 54-year-old street cleaner died today after having a heart attack during the protests there, local health officials said. Yesterday an 18-year-old was killed when a vehicle accelerated into a crowd in the city of Ribeirao Preto, the military police said. The Free Fare Movement that helped organize protests in Sao Paulo said today it wouldn\u2019t call new protests for now.\nPresident Dilma Rousseff , who has been struggling to get in front of the mass movement, met with cabinet members today to discuss emergency measures to help quell violence and prepare proposals on education, health and other demands of protesters, a government official aware of her agenda said.\nThe movement triggered by an increase in bus fares this month has spread amid a groundswell of discontent among Brazil\u2019s middle class. While faster economic growth helped lift 40 million people out of poverty over the past decade, a recent slowdown and faster inflation threaten to erode social gains.\nMarket Sell-Off\n\u201cThe people have the grit to continue,\u201d Natalia Lustoza, a 20-year-old college student, said in Brasilia. \u201cThe protests will only end when we see politicians solving our problems.\u201d\nThe unrest comes less than a month after thousands of people turned out on the streets of Turkey , as anger over the redevelopment of a park turned into a broader protest against the government.\nThe crisis in Brazil comes as the nation\u2019s stocks, bonds and currency are being battered by an emerging markets sell-off and the economy struggles to recover from its second-worst performance in 13 years. The world\u2019s second-biggest emerging market will grow 2.49 percent this year after expanding 0.9 percent in 2012, according to analysts polled by the central bank.\nThe real gained 0.6 percent at 3:32 p.m. local time to 2.2439 per dollar after falling to a four-year low yesterday. The currency is the worst-performing this month among 24 emerging markets tracked by Bloomberg.\nThe Ibovespa (IBOV) stock index fell 2.3 percent, heading for its fourth straight weekly drop, as investors abandon emerging markets on expectations the Federal Reserve will begin tapering a bond-buying program that has flooded emerging markets with cash in recent years. The index has slid 23 percent this year, the worst performer among the world\u2019s 20 biggest equity markets.\nYields Climb\nAverage Brazilian dollar-denominated debt yields climbed above 5 percent this week from 3.6 percent in early May, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. indexes.\nSlideshow: Thousands Protest in Brazil\nBrazil\u2019s annual inflation through mid-June accelerated to 6.67 percent, its fastest pace since November 2011. Urban bus fares rose 1.83 percent in the month through mid-June and made the greatest impact on inflation of all components.\nThe largest demonstrations last night were in Rio and Sao Paulo, where authorities this week revoked a 20 centavo (9 cent) increase in bus fares that became a rallying cry for frustration over the quality and cost of public services. Yet protesters, who largely organized via social networks, marched in 388 cities across the nation of 195 million inhabitants, according to Agencia Estado.\nCanceled Visit\n\u201cThese protests can\u2019t be calmed just with talk,\u201d Oded Grajew, a former businessman who in 2002 helped elect Rousseff\u2019s mentor and predecessor, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva , said in a phone interview from Paris. \u201cThe government needs to come up with concrete answers for this movement not to spin further out of control.\u201d\nRousseff yesterday canceled a state visit to Japan set to begin next week to manage the crisis. Since being jeered by soccer fans June 15 at the opening match of the Confederations Cup, Rousseff, a member of the Marxist underground that battled Brazil\u2019s 1964-1985 military dictatorship, has vowed to listen to what she called \u201cthe voices on the street.\u201d\nThe protests are the largest since those in 1992 that pressed for the impeachment of Fernando Collor, the first directly-elected president following the dictatorship. While the movement may lose steam with its initial and unifying demand met, the situation will remain tense between now and next year\u2019s presidential election, said Joao Augusto de Castro Neves, an analyst at political risk consultancy Eurasia Group.\n\u2018Quality of Life\u2019\n\u201cMore and more the middle class is focusing on the quality of life agenda,\u201d Castro Neves said in a phone interview from Washington . \u201cThey don\u2019t just want a cellphone, they need the phones to work well. They don\u2019t just want cars, they want cars that can ride on the street without traffic jams or potholes.\u201d\nThe approval rating of Rousseff\u2019s government has fallen eight percentage points to 55 percent since March, mostly over growing discontent with quickening inflation , according to an Ibope poll published this week.\nMagnifying protesters\u2019 demand is Brazil\u2019s hosting of the Confederations Cup. The two-week tournament is a warm-up for next year\u2019s World Cup , whose price tag of 30 billion reais has also drawn ire in a nation where 21 percent of the population still lives below the poverty line.\nWorld Cup\nAt a match last night between Spain and Tahiti, fans inside Rio\u2019s Maracana stadium held up a banner reading \u201cWe Don\u2019t Need a World Cup.\u201d Another, displaying the image of Rousseff in her days as a militant, vowed \u201cOur Fight Has Not Finished.\u201d\nFIFA staff at the stadium in Salvador yesterday were told to wait and travel together in a specially organized bus because of the protests there, according to a FIFA official at the stadium who isn\u2019t authorized to speak to the press.

Under current EU rules, anti-smoking images on packages are optional while text warnings are mandatory.\nAt a meeting today in Luxembourg, the ministers also agreed to ban the sale of cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco with characterizing flavors such as menthol. In addition, nicotine-containing products like electronic cigarettes would be regulated under the new rules, which also need the support of the European Parliament to become law.\n\u201cSmoking is one of the greatest avoidable, preventable threats to people\u2019s health,\u201d Irish Health Minister James Reilly told reporters after the agreement. Reilly chaired the Luxembourg meeting and brokered the accord because Ireland holds the 27-nation EU\u2019s rotating presidency.\nTobacco kills as many as 695,000 people a year in the EU, or one person every 45 seconds, according to the European Commission , the bloc\u2019s regulatory arm, which says a third of Europeans still smoke. Smoking is the largest avoidable health risk in Europe, causing more problems than alcohol, drugs, high blood pressure , high cholesterol or obesity, according to the Brussels-based commission, which proposed stricter rules in December.\nRespiratory Diseases\nCancers as well as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases are linked to tobacco use. Saying that 70 percent of smokers start before the age of 18, the commission described the goal of its draft legislation six months ago as to make tobacco goods less attractive to young people.\nUnder today\u2019s ministerial accord, which would revise a 2001 EU law, cigarette packages would also have to include an information message that tobacco smoke contains more than 70 cancer-causing substances. A current EU ban on oral tobacco, along with an exemption for Sweden , would remain.\nThe ministerial deal on the provision relating to the combined pictorial and text alert on packages scaled back the commission proposal. The commission had wanted three-quarters of the front and back of packages to be covered.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Jonathan Stearns in Luxembourg at jstearns2@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Hertling at jhertling@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "postDate": "2013-06-21T17:16:22", "author": "", "title": "Tougher Cigarette Health Warnings Supported by EU Governments"}, {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-23/best-emerging-market-stock-pickers-buy-drugmakers-to-retailers.html", "content": "Best Emerging-Market Stock Pickers Buy Drugmakers to Retailers\nBy Michael Patterson - 2013-06-23T16:07:05Z\nThe only three emerging-market stock pickers who avoided losing money for clients in the worst first-half rout since 1998 say now\u2019s the time to buy Philippine retailers, Chinese Internet companies and Indian drugmakers.\nLewis Kaufman, whose Thornburg Developing World Fund (THDAX) rose 3.2 percent, the most among U.S.-domiciled emerging-market mutual funds overseeing at least $100 million, says Manila-based Puregold Price Club Inc. (PGOLD) will benefit from 20 percent sales growth. CNI Charter Emerging Markets Fund (RIMIX) \u2019s Anindya Chatterjee boosted his position in Shenzhen, China-based Tencent Holdings Ltd. (700) as first-quarter profit rose 37 percent. David Semple has been buying Indian pharmaceutical shares for the Van Eck Emerging Markets Fund as the rupee\u2019s tumble boosts exports.\nThe managers say they weathered this year\u2019s 15 percent slide in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index by making prescient currency bets and buying companies insulated from economic swings and government interference. All 89 of their rivals tracked by Bloomberg posted losses as the U.S. Federal Reserve said it may reduce monetary stimulus, while a cash crunch in China worsened and protests turned violent in Turkey and Brazil.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been an environment where if you picked the right spots, there\u2019s been enough going right to offset the things that are going wrong,\u201d Kaufman, whose fund has about $728 million of assets, said in a June 19 phone interview from Santa Fe, New Mexico. \u201cAnd there are a lot of things going wrong.\u201d\nRelative Value\nThe MSCI emerging-markets index , which tumbled 5.6 percent last week to 900.54, is headed for the worst first half since 1998, just before Russia defaulted on $40 billion of domestic debt.\nThe gauge has trailed the MSCI World Index of developed-nation stocks by 21 percentage points in 2013, the biggest gap in 15 years. The emerging-markets index now is valued at 1.4 times net assets, the lowest level since September 2011 and 28 percent below the MSCI World Index, the biggest discount since 2005, according to weekly data compiled by Bloomberg.\nThe Peru Lima General Index (IGBVL) , Brazil\u2019s Ibovespa and the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index all lost more than 19 percent, the largest declines among 21 emerging-market equity measures tracked by Bloomberg. OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA (OGXP3) , the Rio de Janeiro-based oil explorer controlled by Brazilian billionaire Eike Batista , slid 81 percent for the steepest drop in the MSCI emerging gauge.\nBernanke Effect\nDeveloping-nation currencies and bonds also tumbled in the first half, with India\u2019s rupee and Turkey\u2019s lira sinking to record lows against the dollar last week. The yield on the Bloomberg USD Emerging Market Sovereign Bond Index (BEMS) rose to 5.23 percent on June 21, the highest level since November 2011.\nEven the best-performing emerging-market stock funds have declined in June after Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke mapped out a timetable for ending the central bank\u2019s unprecedented bond-buying program. The Thornburg fund lost about 8.9 percent so far this month, while the CNI fund slid 8 percent and the Van Eck fund dropped 8.3 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with an 11 percent retreat in the MSCI emerging-markets index .\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a very, very tough year for emerging markets overall,\u201d Chatterjee, who started the $227 million CNI fund in December 2011 and oversaw its 1.6 percent advance this year, said in a June 20 phone interview from New York.\nReducing Risk\nBrevan Howard Asset Management LLP\u2019s $2.7 billion emerging-markets hedge fund sold positions and cut risk by more than half after it lost 11 percent this year, two people with knowledge of the matter said last week. Geraldine Sundstrom, who oversees the fund for London-based Brevan Howard, declined to comment.\nThe $328 million Goldman Sachs BRIC Fund (GBRAX) , which invests in Brazil, Russia, India and China, declined 18 percent for the biggest drop among 92 U.S.-domiciled emerging stock mutual funds with at least $100 million tracked by Bloomberg. The $427 million Goldman Sachs N-11 Equity Fund (GSYAX) , comprised of stocks in smaller emerging markets , retreated 8 percent.\n\u201cAs a contrarian and believer in mean reversion, the fact that the BRIC markets have underperformed for a couple years now, that makes me very interested in those markets,\u201d Eddie Perkin, the London-based chief investment officer for international and emerging markets equity at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said in a June 23 phone interview. \u201cThe BRIC and growth market countries have been left behind as the world equity markets have moved ahead and there\u2019s really good value there.\u201d\nFund Outflows\nInvestors withdrew a net $18 billion from emerging-market stock funds during the past 10 weeks, Morgan Stanley wrote in a June 21 report.\nWhile the retreat in emerging markets has left stocks \u201coversold,\u201d the longer-term outlook for the asset class is still negative, John-Paul Smith, the London-based strategist at Deutsche Bank AG who predicted this year\u2019s selloff, said in a June 20 e-mail. He said stocks in China, the biggest emerging market, may extend declines.\nThe World Bank lowered its 2013 forecast for growth in China to 7.7 percent this month, which would be the slowest since 1999, from an 8.4 percent estimate in January. The Washington-based lender cut its prediction for developing-nation growth to 5.1 percent from 5.5 percent, compared with the 1.2 percent projection for advanced economies.\n\u201cThe situation in China is still very bearish for the emerging equity asset class over the medium and longer term,\u201d Smith said.\nFastest Growth\nPuregold, which operates supermarkets and hypermarkets in the Philippines, has climbed 9.1 percent this year. The company will probably boost sales by an average 24 percent during the next three years as profits surge at an 18 percent annual rate, according to 26 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The Philippine economy expanded at a faster-than-projected 7.8 percent pace in the first quarter, the quickest among 40 major nations tracked by Bloomberg.\n\u201cThe country is on the cusp of an investment cycle which I think will filter through to the consumer part of the economy,\u201d Kaufman said. The Philippine peso has become attractive after depreciating about 6 percent against the dollar during the past month, he said.\nKaufman also holds shares of OAO Magnit (MGNT) , Russia\u2019s largest food retailer, and PT Mitra Adiperkasa (MAPI) , which operates Starbucks Corp. and Domino\u2019s Pizza Inc. outlets across Indonesia. The money manager, who joined Thornburg in 2005 after working for Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc., said he has an overweight position in Southeast Asian countries, underweight holdings in the energy industry and no stocks in South Korea. The nation\u2019s benchmark Kospi Index (KOSPI) has dropped 16 percent in dollar terms this year.\nConsumer Bets\nTencent, which boosted users of its mobile messaging application by 228 percent in the first quarter to 194 million, has climbed 15 percent this year. The shares are valued at 25 times estimated 2013 profits, versus 43 times for Menlo Park, California-based Facebook Inc., operator of the largest social network, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nThe Hong Kong-traded company, China\u2019s largest listed Internet business by revenue , was the fourth-biggest position in the CNI fund as of March after Chatterjee boosted holdings in the first quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nThe fund has overweight positions in Asian consumer companies because the region\u2019s expanding populations and high savings rates will spur growth even if the global economy slows, Chatterjee said.\nGlenmark, Apollo\nConsumer spending in Asian emerging markets will probably increase 9.2 percent on average in 2013, according to Euromonitor International, a market research firm.\n\u201cIn this global environment, and even over the longer term, it makes more sense to focus on domestic demand driven by demography,\u201d said Chatterjee, who has covered Asian markets and economies for 18 years at firms including Bear Stearns Cos. and Jefferies Group LLC. \u201cConsumption is more durable through economic cycles.\u201d\nSemple, who has managed international equity investments at Van Eck since 1998, said in a June 19 phone interview that he\u2019s been paring some Chinese holdings and adding to Indian health-care stocks. His emerging-markets fund had Chennai-based Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Ltd. and Mumbai-based Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (GNP) among its top 10 holdings at the end of May, according to Van Eck\u2019s website.\n\u2018Adverse Situations\u2019\nGlenmark, which recorded more than 70 percent of its sales outside India in the three months ended March, has climbed 3.1 percent this year even as the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex index dropped 3.4 percent. The rupee weakened about 7.2 percent in 2013 and reached a record low of 59.98 per dollar on June 20, boosting the value of overseas revenue for local companies.\nSemple, Chatterjee and Kaufman said they tend to avoid state-owned companies as slower economic growth increases the likelihood of government intervention and wasteful spending. Moscow-based OAO Gazprom (GAZP) and Beijing-based China Construction Bank Corp. (939) , state-controlled companies with two of the seven biggest weightings in the MSCI emerging index, dropped more than 16 percent this year.\n\u201cSome of the less efficient emerging-market stocks are being found out in a world of lower growth,\u201d said Semple, whose fund is unchanged this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. \u201cWe don\u2019t think the index is a very good representation of what emerging markets have become. The companies we buy can do very well, even in adverse situations.\u201d\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Michael Patterson in Hong Kong at mpatterson10@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Darren Boey at dboey@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "postDate": "2013-06-23T16:07:05", "author": "", "title": "Best Emerging-Market Stock Pickers Buy Drugmakers to Retailers"}, {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-21/oi-tumbles-in-sao-paulo-trading-as-two-executives-leave-company.html", "content": "Oi Tumbles as Executive Departures Rekindle Dividend Concern\nBy Denyse Godoy - 2013-06-21T22:15:41Z\nOi SA fell the most in three months as the departure of its finance and operations heads two weeks after Zeinal Bava took over as chief executive officer stoked concern that the Brazilian phone company will cut dividends.\nOi\u2019s non-voting shares dropped 10 percent to 3.57 reais at the close of trading in Sao Paulo , the steepest one-day decline since March 22.

That compares with 32 percent in favor of nuclear power and 20 percent opposed in July 2011.\nConcerns about nuclear power rose in France after a March 2011 earthquake and subsequent tsunami crippled Japan \u2019s Fukushima Dai-Ichi power plant, causing three reactor core meltdowns, forcing about 160,000 people to evacuate and leaving about 132 square kilometers as a no-go zone.\nFrench President Francois Hollande has pledged to cut the country\u2019s reliance on nuclear power. Electricite de France SA \u2019s 58 atomic reactors currently provide more than three-quarters of electricity, a proportion Hollande vowed to reduce to 50 percent by around 2025.\nYet the proportion of people who say France should reduce its dependence on nuclear power because of the energy\u2019s dangers is declining. When surveyed late last month, 41 percent held that view, compared with 46 percent who said in March 2013 that the country should reduce its nuclear dependence, the poll showed.\nThe poll was conducted on May 29 and May 30 among 2,004 people age 18 or older and has a margin of error of 1.8 percentage points.\nRecommendations on France\u2019s planned law on energy policy and the country\u2019s power-production mix will be presented to Hollande in September and the bill will reach parliament at the beginning of 2014, Environment Minister Delphine Batho said on June 5.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Alan Katz in Paris at akatz5@bloomberg.net .\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Melissa Pozsgay at mpozsgay@bloomberg.net .\nMore News:\n", "postDate": "2013-06-22T12:41:12", "author": "", "title": "French Support for Nuclear Power Rises Ahead of Law, Poll Shows"}, {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-21/france-to-raise-natural-gas-supply-to-south-regulator-says.html", "content": "France to Raise Natural Gas Supply to South, Regulator Says\nBy Tara Patel - 2013-06-21T08:35:18Z\nFrance \u2019s natural gas distributor will raise capacity on its North-South link in a bid to prevent a repeat of last summer\u2019s price surge and volatility, according to the regulator.\nGRTgaz SA , the French gas pipeline operator controlled by GDF Suez (GSZ) SA, will offer 15 gigawatt-hours a day of additional capacity this summer, the Commission de Regulation de l\u2019Energie said in a May 29 consultation published on its website . The higher capacity is aimed at encouraging additional gas being sent from north to south, where tight supply last year pushed prices higher.\nThe regulator also called on GRTgaz to limit the effects maintenance work may have on capacity of the North-South link in the coming months. The maximum technical capacity on the link is 450 gigawatt-hours a day at present.\nThe measures are a response to what the regulator called a \u201cdisconnect\u201d since the second quarter of 2012 between prices on the southern and northern French spot natural gas markets. The gap widened between April and September last year when it averaged 2.74 euros ($3.62) a megawatt-hour compared with an average of 0.16 euros a megawatt-hour in 2011. The difference prompted the regulator to start a probe into how prices are determined.\nNo \u201cabnormal behavior\u201d by market participants has been detected so far, the regulator said. The price variations are due to a \u201cmassive\u201d diversion of LNG cargoes from Europe to Asia , where prices are higher, and \u201cstructurally\u201d tighter supply to southern France.\nLNG imports to France\u2019s Fos-sur-Mer terminal in the south fell 18 percent from 2011 to 2012 and 55 percent to Montoir-de-Bretagne, the CRE said. At the same time, French pipeline exports to Spain rose.\nIn its recommendations to improve the flow of natural gas to southern France, the regulator said the southern and northern French markets, known as Point d\u2019Echange de Gaz Sud, or PEG Sud, and PEG Nord, should be merged in 2018.\nTransparency in the usage of France\u2019s LNG terminals also needs to be improved, it said.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Tara Patel in Paris at tpatel2@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Will Kennedy at wkennedy3@bloomberg.net\n", "postDate": "2013-06-21T08:35:18", "author": "", "title": "France to Raise Natural Gas Supply to South, Regulator Says"}, {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-20/koc-joins-garanti-as-companies-draw-erdogan-anger-over-protests.html", "content": "Koc Joins Garanti as Companies Draw Erdogan Ire Over Protest\nBy Ercan Ersoy & Firat Kayakiran - 2013-06-21T14:42:22Z\nAs he denounced extremist groups, opposition parties and international media for stoking the protests of the past few weeks, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan spared some of his ire for local companies.\nKoc Holding AS (KCHOL) , whose businesses range from makers of cars and fridges to financial services, and Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN) , the biggest lender, were among the targets. Addressing hundreds of thousands at an Istanbul rally on June 16, Erdogan referred to a Koc-owned hotel in central Istanbul that allowed its lobby to be turned to an infirmary for protesters sprayed with pepper gas during clashes with police the previous evening.\n\u201cWe know who cooperated with terror in their own hotels,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will have to account for it.\u201d\nWhile there\u2019s been no action against any of the companies, the rhetoric raised concerns in a country with historically an uneasy overlap of business and politics. Media group Dogan Yayin Holding AS (DYHOL) was hit by a $3.8 billion tax fine in 2009 after its newspapers got embroiled in a row with ministers over coverage. The government said it resulted from a routine inspection.\nAfter the first week of protests, Erdogan singled out Garanti Chief Executive Officer Ergun Ozen, saying he would oppose any bank manager who stood with the protesters.\nOzen had described himself as a \u201ccapulcu,\u201d meaning riff-raff or looter, mimicking what Erdogan initially had branded the demonstrators. Cem Boyner, chairman of retail chain Boyner Buyuk Magazacilik AS (BOYNR) , earned a similar rebuke from the premier.\nVendetta Target?\nThe protests created a \u201cgrowing risk that certain high-profile individuals and business entities accused of backing the protesters may become the target of a political vendetta by the government in the aftermath of the crisis,\u201d Wolfango Piccoli , an analyst at London-based political-risk assessor Teneo Intelligence, wrote in a June 16 report.\nGaranti and Koc shares have underperformed this month, both dropping more than 17 percent as of the close in Istanbul today, while the benchmark ISE-100 Index (XU100) declined 15 percent.\n\u201cInvestors are very hesitant in the short-term to buy companies that have been criticized,\u201d Berra Doganer, CEO of Turkish Yatirim AS, a brokerage in Istanbul, said by e-mail. Still, \u201ctheir price levels could offer opportunities to buy for medium and long-term investors,\u201d she said.\nErdogan clashed with Koc before. In 2008, Honorary Chairman Rahmi Koc said he would never hire people with moustaches or beards. The mustachioed Erdogan, whose party has roots in Islamist movements, accused him of \u201cprimitive\u201d discrimination.\nAtaturk Roots\nA Koc Holding communication department official, who didn\u2019t want to be identified because of company policy, declined to comment when contacted by telephone yesterday.\nKoc, which has joint ventures with Fiat SpA (F) and Ford Motor Co. (F) and runs Turkey \u2019s only oil refiner, is one of the country\u2019s older business groups, with roots in the early years of the secular republic founded by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk in 1923.\nIn February, Erdogan\u2019s government canceled a $5.7 billion sale of rights to operate toll roads and bridges to a group including Koc, which had won an auction against two rival bidders two months earlier. It said the price was too low.\nGaranti has been caught in the middle of the political battleground because, even as Erdogan was rebuking its CEO, the bank was targeted by the anti-government protesters. Their anger was directed not at Ozen, but at billionaire Ferit Sahenk.\nSahenk\u2019s Dogus Group, one of Garanti\u2019s main shareholders in partnership with Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) , also owns television stations including news channel NTV. Like other Turkish broadcasters, NTV\u2019s lack of coverage on the first night of the protests over the development of Istanbul\u2019s central square later made it and associated businesses a target.\nBoycott Risk\nClients canceled 1,500 credit cards and pulled as much as 40 million liras ($21 million) from Garanti in the week through June 4 to protest the coverage on Dogus media, Ozen said.\n\u201cCertain companies or shareholders have unwillingly found themselves between two fires as the political environment got increasingly polarized,\u201d Eli Koen, the co-head of emerging Europe equities at Union Bancaire Privee in London , said by e-mail on June 13. \u201cAny company that falls on the wrong side of either party in this conflict carries a risk of boycott.\u201d\nErdogan and other ministers have criticized banks more broadly for being part of an \u201cinterest-rate lobby\u201d seeking to exploit the unrest by pushing borrowing costs up and boosting profits. Erdogan urged depositors to move their money from private to state banks.\n\u201cOur bankers are living in a glass castle,\u201d Deputy Prime Minister Ali Babacan said on June 14. \u201cIf you live in a glass castle you should not throw stones at anybody otherwise the consequences will be bad.\u201d\nRiff-Raff\nErdogan draws his strongest support from among the poorest sections of Turkish society.\nEconomic growth exceeding 5 percent a year during his decade in power has propelled him to three successive election victories, the last one with 50 percent of the vote in 2011.

The BIS, based in Basel , Switzerland and owned by 60 central banks, hosts the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision , a group of regulators and central bankers that sets global capital standards.\n\u201cMarket commentary has suggested that much of this trend reflects banks\u2019 optimization of risk-weighted assets -- the redesign of transactions in order to lower capital requirements -- rather than a genuine increase in loss absorption capacity,\u201d the BIS said. \u201cSuch window-dressing raises questions about the use of internal risk assessments for the determination of regulatory capital requirements .\u201d\nThe BIS adds to a chorus of international regulators that are increasingly looking at leverage, in addition to capital measures based on risk weightings assigned to different assets, to gauge banks\u2019 financial strength. Their focus intensified as some banks improved capital ratios following the financial crisis by altering internal models or cutting risk-weighted assets without correspondingly shrinking their balance sheets.\nUBS AG (UBSN) and Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , the largest Swiss banks, were told last week to increase their ratios of capital to total assets. Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE) , Denmark\u2019s biggest lender, was told by the country\u2019s financial watchdog it had underestimated risky assets. U.S. regulators are considering doubling the ratio of capital to 6 percent of total assets, according to four people with knowledge of the talks who asked not to be named.\nBasel Rules\nLenders in the U.S. and in more than 100 other countries already comply with Basel\u2019s risk-based capital rules, which assign weightings to assets based on their riskiness. Corporate debt is given a heavier weight than government bonds , requiring that more capital be held against it. The weighting affects the profitability of trading and investing in those assets.\nWhile firms submit their models to national regulators for validation, they don\u2019t have to disclose them publicly. Surveys by the Basel Committee have shown that risk-weightings for the same assets vary among banks, undermining their credibility.\n\u201cThe range of variation indicates that the interaction of risk-sensitive rules with the complexity of risk modeling has created a wide scope for inconsistency, which can seriously weaken both the credibility and the effectiveness of the framework,\u201d the BIS said.\nUnwanted Variation\nThe BIS\u2019s analysis based on samples of large globally active banks shows that European lenders\u2019 risk-weighted assets were at 28 percent of total assets at the end of last year, a value that has changed little over the past eight years. The ratio is at 58 percent for U.S. banks, which have reduced it from a peak of 77 percent in 2008. Japanese and U.K. banks have also reduced assets by lowering risk weights over the last five years.\nPart of the difference is due to accounting methods. U.S. rules allow the netting out of derivative positions, while the international standard used by European banks doesn\u2019t and hence inflates total assets of banks such as Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) or BNP Paribas SA (BNP) compared to U.S. peers like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) Different business models also matter.\nStill, even within the same jurisdiction, risk weights can vary widely. There are several factors driving the variation, some of which can be desirable as it allows banks to compete and the market to \u201cbalance the views of bulls and bears,\u201d the BIS said. Distortions come from different parameters used by the lenders, from statistical \u201cnoise\u201d and crucially, from bankers\u2019 optimistic bias.\n\u2018Undermine Efforts\u2019\n\u201cDifferences due to strategic choices by banks are unwelcome because they undermine regulatory efforts,\u201d the BIS said. \u201cManagement interventions in the models skew risk assessments downwards by understating potential loss.\u201d\nTo be sure, the BIS advises against throwing out the risk weighting entirely in favor of relying solely on the leverage ratio , which compares capital against total, unweighted assets. Having only that gauge to measure a bank\u2019s resilience would also create false incentives for banks that could diminish, rather than strengthen stability.\n\u201cThe leverage ratio does not address the problem of incentives,\u201d it said. \u201cFor a given ratio, banks seeking to minimize regulatory capital can simply reallocate their portfolios toward riskier activities, or shrink their balance sheet without necessarily reducing their potential losses.\u201d\n\u2018Harnessing Strengths\u2019\nInstead of just relying on one of the two ratios, regulators should take advantage of the fact that \u201cit is difficult to manipulate one without affecting the other, typically in the opposite direction,\u201d the BIS said. The right response for regulators is \u201charnessing the complementary strengths\u201d while improving the risk weights by more oversight.\nRegulators should address the unwanted variation of weightings by more transparency into the models\u2019 inner workings, as well as by standardization and less discretion for banks in setting their parameters, which would also help to prevent \u201cstatistical noise,\u201d the BIS said.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Boris Groendahl in Vienna at bgroendahl@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Frank Connelly at fconnelly@bloomberg.net\nBanks\u2019 Window-Dressing Undermines Risk-Weight Trust, BIS Says\nLinus Hook/Bloomberg\nDanske Bank A/S, Denmark\u2019s biggest lender, was told by the country\u2019s financial watchdog it had underestimated risky assets.\nDanske Bank A/S, Denmark\u2019s biggest lender, was told by the country\u2019s financial watchdog it had underestimated risky assets.

Today\u2019s remarks were her first since June 18, when the former Marxist guerrilla vowed to listen to \u201cthe voices of the street,\u201d a promise she repeated tonight.\nAs she spoke, hundreds of protesters blocked the highway to Sao Paulo\u2019s international airport, forcing police to beef up security. In Rio de Janeiro, protesters marched peacefully in the beach-side neighborhood of Leblon to the home of Governor Sergio Cabral. Elsewhere in the city smaller groups battled police and sacked storefronts.\nIn her address, delivered from the presidential palace, Rousseff said that her government would maintain order and urged Brazilians to reciprocate the warm hospitality the country\u2019s soccer squad has for decades received abroad and organize a peaceful and orderly World Cup next year.\n\u201cWith respect, warmth and happiness we should treat our guests,\u201d Rousseff said.\nOil Royalties\nRousseff didn\u2019t outline new policy action in the nine-minute speech but instead repeated a pledge to earmark for education 100 percent of the royalties Brazil stands to earn from offshore oil finds.\nShe said she\u2019d meet with protesters to listen to their demands and tap their energy to pursue a pact with local authorities to deliver improvements in public transport. She also endorsed a plan to bring thousands of doctors from abroad to improve the quality of health care at state clinics.\nAfter watching last night from the presidential palace crowds gather in what was the biggest mass protest yet, Rousseff today met with members of her cabinet to discuss emergency measures to quell the violence and seek solutions to demands for better education, health care and other public services.\n\u201cBrazil struggled a lot to become a democratic country and it\u2019s struggling a lot to become a more just country,\u201d she said tonight.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Joshua Goodman in Rio de Janeiro at jgoodman19@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Andre Soliani at asoliani@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "postDate": "2013-06-22T00:55:28", "author": "", "title": "Rousseff Says Violence Embarrassing Brazil Needs to Be Curbed"}, {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-20/rajoy-targets-utility-revenue-to-curb-spanish-debt-loan.html", "content": "Rajoy Targets Utility Revenue to Curb Spanish Debt Loan\nBy Marc Roca - 2013-06-20T23:01:00Z\nSpanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy \u2019s government is preparing to cut the regulated revenue of electric utilities and renewable-energy generators, threatening their profits as it tries to curb the nation\u2019s debt.\nPower producers Iberdrola SA (IBE) and Endesa SA (ELE) along with wind-plant owners Acciona SA (ANA) , Enel Green Power SpA (EGPW) and EDP Renovaveis SA face an earnings decline should their reimbursements be reduced for selling power below market rates, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley (MS) and Macquarie Bank Ltd. The analysts see solar operators being hit hardest.\nDecreasing income for wind- and solar-power plants may undermine some of the 55 billion euros ($73 billion) of loans they\u2019ve taken from banks such as Spain \u2019s Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) , according to Macquarie. Rajoy\u2019s moves follow concerns among governments from Japan to Germany that the prices paid for clean energy subsidies are too high.\n\u201cWe expect regulated revenues to come down for both traditional and renewable operators, though the scale of each reduction remains uncertain,\u201d Morgan Stanley analysts Carolina Dores and Anna Maria Scaglia said in a research note. \u201cWe would avoid stocks with large exposure to electricity\u201d in Spain. Dores declined to be interviewed, citing company policy.\nRajoy is working to rein in a 26 billion-euro ($33.7 billion) debt owed to utilities, a state-guaranteed payback to them in return for selling electricity to consumers at too low a price to cover all their costs. The debt has grown for a decade because regulators cap rates, or tariffs, at levels not high enough to reimburse services such as power transmission and generating from more expensive renewable sources.\nDecision Due\nDecrees with measures to reshape the power system are likely to be sent to the Cabinet for approval this month, according to an Industry Ministry spokesman who asked not to be named, in line with a government policy. Industry Minister Jose Manuel Soria said at a hearing in congress on June 19 the decision might slip until the middle of July.\n\u201cThe increase of unforeseen costs seriously threatens the stability of the power system,\u201d Soria said at the hearing in Madrid . \u201cIt\u2019s threatening the power system. It also threatens, if it continues to grow, the stability of the financial system.\u201d\nThe cuts due in the next few weeks covering the tariff deficit will be followed by a more comprehensive package of changes to rein in costs in the wholesale power market after Parliament\u2019s summer recess, according to JP Morgan and the solar lobby group UNEF.\nUtility Impact\nSpokesmen at each of the electric companies declined to comment. The Association of Spanish Banks has met with ministers to discuss energy reforms, said Encarna Perez, spokeswoman for the group that represents BBVA and its competitors. UNESA, which represents Endesa, Iberdrola, Gas Natural SDG SA (GAS) , EDP and EON AG (EOAN) , said utilities are already suffering from recent measures that reduced revenue by 3.2 billion euros over the past year.\nRenewable energy operators that earn about 6 billion euros a year in subsidies fear more cuts are on the way. Like conventional generators, they were already hit by a 7 percent tax on their revenue in December and a lower allowance for inflation in February.\nSpain\u2019s biggest solar power operators are Fotowatio SL and Grupo T-Solar Global SA. Jorge Barredo, president of the solar lobby group UNEF, expects a cut of about 1.2 billion euros for renewables including limits to earnings of photovoltaic plants. PV plants have been losing 700 million euros a year in revenue since 2011 because of limits on the hours they can earn subsidies.\nReturns Threatened\nThe nation\u2019s six top electricity companies this year have returned 4.1 percent through June 19, compared with a 6.1 percent return by the benchmark Ibex 35 index in the period. Power demand has declined with the recession in Spain, adding to a surplus of generation capacity that\u2019s already as much as 60 percent higher than what\u2019s needed.\nGenerators \u201ccan\u2019t cope with more cuts\u201d because they\u2019re already at the \u201cthreshold of profitability,\u201d Eduardo Montes, president of utilities trade group UNESA, said by phone.\nThe regulated system, which includes transport, distribution and clean energy subsidies, created a 5.6 billion-euro shortfall last year, according to data from the power regulator known by its initials CNE. The other half of consumer bills comes mainly from prices set in the wholesale power market, where companies trade electricity and traditionally have made profits.\nAnalyst Forecasts\nJP Morgan expects immediate measures to cut the regulated power system\u2019s revenue as much as 2.2 billion euros. Renewable energy led by solar may take up to 1.4 billion euros of the cut, lowering 15 percent to 16 percent of what generators earn, the bank said in a June 18 note. It expects earnings to drop 5 percent to 7 percent at Iberdrola and Enel SpA (ENEL) and by as much as 10 percent at Endesa.\nMorgan Stanley sees the government eliminating its forecast of annual gaps of about 4 billion euros by splitting the cost between itself and power generators. It said the distribution-grid operator, Red Electrica (REE) Corporacion SA, is the most exposed, followed by Endesa SA. They could see 2014 earnings reduced by 36 percent and 21 percent, respectively, in the worst-case scenario.\nMacquarie said Acciona\u2019s earnings could fall 35 percent if wind revenue per megawatt-hour is cut by 10 percent. With the same assumption, earnings may drop 22 percent at EDP and 4 percent at both Iberdrola and Enel Green Power. If solar gets a similar 10 percent reduction, Acciona\u2019s profit may drop 50 percent, the bank estimated.\nBank Risk\nBanks including BBVA have been warned to prepare for refinancing loans to the industry, which top 25 billion euros for both solar PV and wind projects and another 5 billion euros for solar thermal projects, according to Macquarie. BBVA declined to comment.\nShai Hill, head of European power research at Macquarie, said he sees a risk of a \u201cradical\u201d restructuring to the power system in a way that would hurt the lowest-cost generators the most -- nuclear and hydropower plants.\n\u201cIf you beat up wind and solar significantly more, we will see multiple project-level bank debt defaults,\u201d Hill said.\nSoria, the industry minister, has said the measures seek to reduce the cost of the regulated power system. The so-called tariff deficit has surged since Spain boosted subsidies for solar power in 2007 and adds to the government\u2019s liabilities, undermining efforts to trim the euro area\u2019s third-biggest budget deficit .\nSoria\u2019s Hints\nNeither Soria nor other ministers have given details about what measures they plan, saying only that they will cut revenue from all regulated activities and guarantee reasonable returns for all technologies.\n\u201cWe are not considering a revision of the feed-in tariffs for renewables,\u201d Soria said at a conference on June 11, according to El Pais. \u201cIt\u2019s about paying them according what the law states, which is a reasonable remuneration, and that there are no differences among regulated activities.\u201d\nThe annual tariff deficit, which generates off-balance sheet liabilities for the state, reached its highest level since 2008 last year.\nBudget Deficit\nSpain\u2019s overall budget gap for 2013 is forecast to be 6.6 percent, according to the International Monetary Fund , trailing only Ireland and Slovenia among the nations sharing the euro. Spain is seeking to reduce the call on taxpayer funds without boosting the cost of power paid by consumers again.\nLuis Crespo, president of the Protermosolar lobby group for solar-thermal project developers, said banks have been warned they \u201cwill have to do something to avoid getting many installations in payment defaults.\u201d\n\u201cIt seems the government has told banks that they will cut payments to renewables and that if they don\u2019t improve financing conditions, operators won\u2019t be able to keep their commitments,\u201d Crespo said. He also said not all technologies should get the same returns because some are more risky.\nSpain has joined Germany, Italy and the U.K. in reducing subsidies for clean energy amid concerns the cost of incentives is driving up power bills for consumers. In Spain, subsidies accounting for almost half of its 20 billion-euro regulated power system, a level the government deems unsustainable.\nA \u201cnew regulatory model\u201d with measures that \u201cwon\u2019t be liked\u201d is absolutely essential, Soria said May 20 in a meeting, according to its minutes.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Marc Roca in London at mroca6@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Reed Landberg at landberg@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "postDate": "2013-06-20T23:01:00", "author": "", "title": "Rajoy Targets Utility Revenue to Curb Spanish Debt Loan"}, {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-21/hutchison-said-close-to-buying-telefonica-s-o2-ireland.html", "content": "Hutchison Said Close to Buying Telefonica\u2019s O2 Ireland\nBy Joe Brennan, Matthew Campbell & Manuel Baigorri - 2013-06-21T18:18:35Z\nHutchison Whampoa Ltd.

Members include MillerCoors LLC and Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (ABI) \u2019s Anheuser-Busch unit, according to the organization\u2019s website .\nThe beermakers join LME users including industrial copper companies in complaining about long waits for metal in warehouses monitored by the exchange.

Violence later erupted with police battling mobs trying to storm the Foreign Ministry in Brasilia and Rio de Janeiro \u2019s city hall.\nIn the northern city of Belem, a 54-year-old street cleaner died today after having a heart attack during the protests there, local health officials said. Yesterday an 18-year-old was killed when a vehicle accelerated into a crowd in the city of Ribeirao Preto, the military police said. The Free Fare Movement that helped organize protests in Sao Paulo said today it wouldn\u2019t call new protests for now.\nPresident Dilma Rousseff , who has been struggling to get in front of the mass movement, met with cabinet members today to discuss emergency measures to help quell violence and prepare proposals on education, health and other demands of protesters, a government official aware of her agenda said.\nThe movement triggered by an increase in bus fares this month has spread amid a groundswell of discontent among Brazil\u2019s middle class. While faster economic growth helped lift 40 million people out of poverty over the past decade, a recent slowdown and faster inflation threaten to erode social gains.\nMarket Sell-Off\n\u201cThe people have the grit to continue,\u201d Natalia Lustoza, a 20-year-old college student, said in Brasilia. \u201cThe protests will only end when we see politicians solving our problems.\u201d\nThe unrest comes less than a month after thousands of people turned out on the streets of Turkey , as anger over the redevelopment of a park turned into a broader protest against the government.\nThe crisis in Brazil comes as the nation\u2019s stocks, bonds and currency are being battered by an emerging markets sell-off and the economy struggles to recover from its second-worst performance in 13 years. The world\u2019s second-biggest emerging market will grow 2.49 percent this year after expanding 0.9 percent in 2012, according to analysts polled by the central bank.\nThe real gained 0.6 percent at 3:32 p.m. local time to 2.2439 per dollar after falling to a four-year low yesterday. The currency is the worst-performing this month among 24 emerging markets tracked by Bloomberg.\nThe Ibovespa (IBOV) stock index fell 2.3 percent, heading for its fourth straight weekly drop, as investors abandon emerging markets on expectations the Federal Reserve will begin tapering a bond-buying program that has flooded emerging markets with cash in recent years. The index has slid 23 percent this year, the worst performer among the world\u2019s 20 biggest equity markets.\nYields Climb\nAverage Brazilian dollar-denominated debt yields climbed above 5 percent this week from 3.6 percent in early May, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. indexes.\nSlideshow: Thousands Protest in Brazil\nBrazil\u2019s annual inflation through mid-June accelerated to 6.67 percent, its fastest pace since November 2011. Urban bus fares rose 1.83 percent in the month through mid-June and made the greatest impact on inflation of all components.\nThe largest demonstrations last night were in Rio and Sao Paulo, where authorities this week revoked a 20 centavo (9 cent) increase in bus fares that became a rallying cry for frustration over the quality and cost of public services. Yet protesters, who largely organized via social networks, marched in 388 cities across the nation of 195 million inhabitants, according to Agencia Estado.\nCanceled Visit\n\u201cThese protests can\u2019t be calmed just with talk,\u201d Oded Grajew, a former businessman who in 2002 helped elect Rousseff\u2019s mentor and predecessor, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva , said in a phone interview from Paris. \u201cThe government needs to come up with concrete answers for this movement not to spin further out of control.\u201d\nRousseff yesterday canceled a state visit to Japan set to begin next week to manage the crisis. Since being jeered by soccer fans June 15 at the opening match of the Confederations Cup, Rousseff, a member of the Marxist underground that battled Brazil\u2019s 1964-1985 military dictatorship, has vowed to listen to what she called \u201cthe voices on the street.\u201d\nThe protests are the largest since those in 1992 that pressed for the impeachment of Fernando Collor, the first directly-elected president following the dictatorship. While the movement may lose steam with its initial and unifying demand met, the situation will remain tense between now and next year\u2019s presidential election, said Joao Augusto de Castro Neves, an analyst at political risk consultancy Eurasia Group.\n\u2018Quality of Life\u2019\n\u201cMore and more the middle class is focusing on the quality of life agenda,\u201d Castro Neves said in a phone interview from Washington . \u201cThey don\u2019t just want a cellphone, they need the phones to work well. They don\u2019t just want cars, they want cars that can ride on the street without traffic jams or potholes.\u201d\nThe approval rating of Rousseff\u2019s government has fallen eight percentage points to 55 percent since March, mostly over growing discontent with quickening inflation , according to an Ibope poll published this week.\nMagnifying protesters\u2019 demand is Brazil\u2019s hosting of the Confederations Cup. The two-week tournament is a warm-up for next year\u2019s World Cup , whose price tag of 30 billion reais has also drawn ire in a nation where 21 percent of the population still lives below the poverty line.\nWorld Cup\nAt a match last night between Spain and Tahiti, fans inside Rio\u2019s Maracana stadium held up a banner reading \u201cWe Don\u2019t Need a World Cup.\u201d Another, displaying the image of Rousseff in her days as a militant, vowed \u201cOur Fight Has Not Finished.\u201d\nFIFA staff at the stadium in Salvador yesterday were told to wait and travel together in a specially organized bus because of the protests there, according to a FIFA official at the stadium who isn\u2019t authorized to speak to the press. They usually share a fleet of seven or eight cars to travel between their hotel and the Fonte Nova arena.\nAlmost 1 million people marched in 27 capital cities, Folha reported, citing police estimates in each state. That\u2019s four times the estimated turnout on June 18, which was the previous record for the growing movement.\nRio Violence\nIn Rio, O Globo newspaper estimated 300,000 people turned out yesterday. While the demonstrations there were largely peaceful, a group of stone-throwing protesters who set upon city hall were met by cavalry and foot soldiers firing rubber bullets. More than 60 people were injured, including eight police officers, Mayor Eduardo Paes told reporters today. In Brasilia, more than 120 were hurt, according to Globo TV .\nSergio Cabral, governor of Rio de Janeiro state, said police acted appropriately given the tension generated by some protesters\u2019 use of violence. Any reports of excessive use of force will be investigated, he said.\nA leader of the Free Pass Movement, Rafael Siqueira, said today the group was calling off new protests in Sao Paulo to reflect on how to proceed, and because other groups are taking advantage of the marches to carry out acts of violence.\nIn Ribeirao Preto, a city in the prosperous farm belt surrounding Sao Paulo, a Land Rover mowed into a small crowd, injuring three and killing Marcos Delefrate, who became the first victim of the student-led movement, Folha said.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve taken the first step,\u201d said Fabiean Jambeiro, a 25-year-old human resources professional whose parents only obtained a middle-school education. \u201cNow that everyone is in the streets we\u2019re going to achieve more.\u201d\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Joshua Goodman in Rio de Janeiro at jgoodman19@bloomberg.net ; David Biller in Rio de Janeiro at dbiller1@bloomberg.net ; Raymond Colitt in Brasilia Newsroom at rcolitt@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Andre Soliani at asoliani@bloomberg.net\nBrazilian Revolt Claims First Fatality as Protests Turn Violent\nDado Galdieri/Bloomberg\nA protester uses a mobile phone as he walks past a fire during demonstrations in downtown Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\nA protester uses a mobile phone as he walks past a fire during demonstrations in downtown Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

Under current EU rules, anti-smoking images on packages are optional while text warnings are mandatory.\nAt a meeting today in Luxembourg, the ministers also agreed to ban the sale of cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco with characterizing flavors such as menthol. In addition, nicotine-containing products like electronic cigarettes would be regulated under the new rules, which also need the support of the European Parliament to become law.\n\u201cSmoking is one of the greatest avoidable, preventable threats to people\u2019s health,\u201d Irish Health Minister James Reilly told reporters after the agreement. Reilly chaired the Luxembourg meeting and brokered the accord because Ireland holds the 27-nation EU\u2019s rotating presidency.\nTobacco kills as many as 695,000 people a year in the EU, or one person every 45 seconds, according to the European Commission , the bloc\u2019s regulatory arm, which says a third of Europeans still smoke. Smoking is the largest avoidable health risk in Europe, causing more problems than alcohol, drugs, high blood pressure , high cholesterol or obesity, according to the Brussels-based commission, which proposed stricter rules in December.\nRespiratory Diseases\nCancers as well as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases are linked to tobacco use. Saying that 70 percent of smokers start before the age of 18, the commission described the goal of its draft legislation six months ago as to make tobacco goods less attractive to young people.\nUnder today\u2019s ministerial accord, which would revise a 2001 EU law, cigarette packages would also have to include an information message that tobacco smoke contains more than 70 cancer-causing substances. A current EU ban on oral tobacco, along with an exemption for Sweden , would remain.\nThe ministerial deal on the provision relating to the combined pictorial and text alert on packages scaled back the commission proposal. The commission had wanted three-quarters of the front and back of packages to be covered.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Jonathan Stearns in Luxembourg at jstearns2@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Hertling at jhertling@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "postDate": "2013-06-21T17:16:22", "author": "", "title": "Tougher Cigarette Health Warnings Supported by EU Governments"}, {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-23/best-emerging-market-stock-pickers-buy-drugmakers-to-retailers.html", "content": "Best Emerging-Market Stock Pickers Buy Drugmakers to Retailers\nBy Michael Patterson - 2013-06-23T16:07:05Z\nThe only three emerging-market stock pickers who avoided losing money for clients in the worst first-half rout since 1998 say now\u2019s the time to buy Philippine retailers, Chinese Internet companies and Indian drugmakers.\nLewis Kaufman, whose Thornburg Developing World Fund (THDAX) rose 3.2 percent, the most among U.S.-domiciled emerging-market mutual funds overseeing at least $100 million, says Manila-based Puregold Price Club Inc. (PGOLD) will benefit from 20 percent sales growth. CNI Charter Emerging Markets Fund (RIMIX) \u2019s Anindya Chatterjee boosted his position in Shenzhen, China-based Tencent Holdings Ltd. (700) as first-quarter profit rose 37 percent. David Semple has been buying Indian pharmaceutical shares for the Van Eck Emerging Markets Fund as the rupee\u2019s tumble boosts exports.\nThe managers say they weathered this year\u2019s 15 percent slide in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index by making prescient currency bets and buying companies insulated from economic swings and government interference. All 89 of their rivals tracked by Bloomberg posted losses as the U.S. Federal Reserve said it may reduce monetary stimulus, while a cash crunch in China worsened and protests turned violent in Turkey and Brazil.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been an environment where if you picked the right spots, there\u2019s been enough going right to offset the things that are going wrong,\u201d Kaufman, whose fund has about $728 million of assets, said in a June 19 phone interview from Santa Fe, New Mexico. \u201cAnd there are a lot of things going wrong.\u201d\nRelative Value\nThe MSCI emerging-markets index , which tumbled 5.6 percent last week to 900.54, is headed for the worst first half since 1998, just before Russia defaulted on $40 billion of domestic debt.\nThe gauge has trailed the MSCI World Index of developed-nation stocks by 21 percentage points in 2013, the biggest gap in 15 years. The emerging-markets index now is valued at 1.4 times net assets, the lowest level since September 2011 and 28 percent below the MSCI World Index, the biggest discount since 2005, according to weekly data compiled by Bloomberg.\nThe Peru Lima General Index (IGBVL) , Brazil\u2019s Ibovespa and the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index all lost more than 19 percent, the largest declines among 21 emerging-market equity measures tracked by Bloomberg. OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA (OGXP3) , the Rio de Janeiro-based oil explorer controlled by Brazilian billionaire Eike Batista , slid 81 percent for the steepest drop in the MSCI emerging gauge.\nBernanke Effect\nDeveloping-nation currencies and bonds also tumbled in the first half, with India\u2019s rupee and Turkey\u2019s lira sinking to record lows against the dollar last week. The yield on the Bloomberg USD Emerging Market Sovereign Bond Index (BEMS) rose to 5.23 percent on June 21, the highest level since November 2011.\nEven the best-performing emerging-market stock funds have declined in June after Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke mapped out a timetable for ending the central bank\u2019s unprecedented bond-buying program. The Thornburg fund lost about 8.9 percent so far this month, while the CNI fund slid 8 percent and the Van Eck fund dropped 8.3 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with an 11 percent retreat in the MSCI emerging-markets index .\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a very, very tough year for emerging markets overall,\u201d Chatterjee, who started the $227 million CNI fund in December 2011 and oversaw its 1.6 percent advance this year, said in a June 20 phone interview from New York.\nReducing Risk\nBrevan Howard Asset Management LLP\u2019s $2.7 billion emerging-markets hedge fund sold positions and cut risk by more than half after it lost 11 percent this year, two people with knowledge of the matter said last week. Geraldine Sundstrom, who oversees the fund for London-based Brevan Howard, declined to comment.\nThe $328 million Goldman Sachs BRIC Fund (GBRAX) , which invests in Brazil, Russia, India and China, declined 18 percent for the biggest drop among 92 U.S.-domiciled emerging stock mutual funds with at least $100 million tracked by Bloomberg. The $427 million Goldman Sachs N-11 Equity Fund (GSYAX) , comprised of stocks in smaller emerging markets , retreated 8 percent.\n\u201cAs a contrarian and believer in mean reversion, the fact that the BRIC markets have underperformed for a couple years now, that makes me very interested in those markets,\u201d Eddie Perkin, the London-based chief investment officer for international and emerging markets equity at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said in a June 23 phone interview. \u201cThe BRIC and growth market countries have been left behind as the world equity markets have moved ahead and there\u2019s really good value there.\u201d\nFund Outflows\nInvestors withdrew a net $18 billion from emerging-market stock funds during the past 10 weeks, Morgan Stanley wrote in a June 21 report.\nWhile the retreat in emerging markets has left stocks \u201coversold,\u201d the longer-term outlook for the asset class is still negative, John-Paul Smith, the London-based strategist at Deutsche Bank AG who predicted this year\u2019s selloff, said in a June 20 e-mail. He said stocks in China, the biggest emerging market, may extend declines.\nThe World Bank lowered its 2013 forecast for growth in China to 7.7 percent this month, which would be the slowest since 1999, from an 8.4 percent estimate in January. The Washington-based lender cut its prediction for developing-nation growth to 5.1 percent from 5.5 percent, compared with the 1.2 percent projection for advanced economies.\n\u201cThe situation in China is still very bearish for the emerging equity asset class over the medium and longer term,\u201d Smith said.\nFastest Growth\nPuregold, which operates supermarkets and hypermarkets in the Philippines, has climbed 9.1 percent this year. The company will probably boost sales by an average 24 percent during the next three years as profits surge at an 18 percent annual rate, according to 26 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The Philippine economy expanded at a faster-than-projected 7.8 percent pace in the first quarter, the quickest among 40 major nations tracked by Bloomberg.\n\u201cThe country is on the cusp of an investment cycle which I think will filter through to the consumer part of the economy,\u201d Kaufman said. The Philippine peso has become attractive after depreciating about 6 percent against the dollar during the past month, he said.\nKaufman also holds shares of OAO Magnit (MGNT) , Russia\u2019s largest food retailer, and PT Mitra Adiperkasa (MAPI) , which operates Starbucks Corp. and Domino\u2019s Pizza Inc. outlets across Indonesia. The money manager, who joined Thornburg in 2005 after working for Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc., said he has an overweight position in Southeast Asian countries, underweight holdings in the energy industry and no stocks in South Korea. The nation\u2019s benchmark Kospi Index (KOSPI) has dropped 16 percent in dollar terms this year.\nConsumer Bets\nTencent, which boosted users of its mobile messaging application by 228 percent in the first quarter to 194 million, has climbed 15 percent this year. The shares are valued at 25 times estimated 2013 profits, versus 43 times for Menlo Park, California-based Facebook Inc., operator of the largest social network, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nThe Hong Kong-traded company, China\u2019s largest listed Internet business by revenue , was the fourth-biggest position in the CNI fund as of March after Chatterjee boosted holdings in the first quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nThe fund has overweight positions in Asian consumer companies because the region\u2019s expanding populations and high savings rates will spur growth even if the global economy slows, Chatterjee said.\nGlenmark, Apollo\nConsumer spending in Asian emerging markets will probably increase 9.2 percent on average in 2013, according to Euromonitor International, a market research firm.\n\u201cIn this global environment, and even over the longer term, it makes more sense to focus on domestic demand driven by demography,\u201d said Chatterjee, who has covered Asian markets and economies for 18 years at firms including Bear Stearns Cos. and Jefferies Group LLC. \u201cConsumption is more durable through economic cycles.\u201d\nSemple, who has managed international equity investments at Van Eck since 1998, said in a June 19 phone interview that he\u2019s been paring some Chinese holdings and adding to Indian health-care stocks. His emerging-markets fund had Chennai-based Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Ltd. and Mumbai-based Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (GNP) among its top 10 holdings at the end of May, according to Van Eck\u2019s website.\n\u2018Adverse Situations\u2019\nGlenmark, which recorded more than 70 percent of its sales outside India in the three months ended March, has climbed 3.1 percent this year even as the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex index dropped 3.4 percent. The rupee weakened about 7.2 percent in 2013 and reached a record low of 59.98 per dollar on June 20, boosting the value of overseas revenue for local companies.\nSemple, Chatterjee and Kaufman said they tend to avoid state-owned companies as slower economic growth increases the likelihood of government intervention and wasteful spending. Moscow-based OAO Gazprom (GAZP) and Beijing-based China Construction Bank Corp. (939) , state-controlled companies with two of the seven biggest weightings in the MSCI emerging index, dropped more than 16 percent this year.\n\u201cSome of the less efficient emerging-market stocks are being found out in a world of lower growth,\u201d said Semple, whose fund is unchanged this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. \u201cWe don\u2019t think the index is a very good representation of what emerging markets have become. The companies we buy can do very well, even in adverse situations.\u201d\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Michael Patterson in Hong Kong at mpatterson10@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Darren Boey at dboey@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "postDate": "2013-06-23T16:07:05", "author": "", "title": "Best Emerging-Market Stock Pickers Buy Drugmakers to Retailers"}, {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-21/oi-tumbles-in-sao-paulo-trading-as-two-executives-leave-company.html", "content": "Oi Tumbles as Executive Departures Rekindle Dividend Concern\nBy Denyse Godoy - 2013-06-21T22:15:41Z\nOi SA fell the most in three months as the departure of its finance and operations heads two weeks after Zeinal Bava took over as chief executive officer stoked concern that the Brazilian phone company will cut dividends.\nOi\u2019s non-voting shares dropped 10 percent to 3.57 reais at the close of trading in Sao Paulo , the steepest one-day decline since March 22. The Ibovespa stock benchmark retreated 2.4 percent.\nChief Financial Officer Alex Zornig and Chief Operating Officer James Meaney have left the company, Oi said in a regulatory filing after the close of trading yesterday. The departures come as Bava faces pressure to deliver 2 billion reais ($884 million) in dividends that the company has pledged this year.\nThe shakeup appears to represent the end of Oi\u2019s strategic plan announced more than a year ago, and the company \u201cwill likely revise its guidance, investment plan and dividend policy, probably leading the company to cut its dividends plan and prioritize capex and deleveraging,\u201d Banco Bradesco SA analysts Luis Azevedo and Tales Freire wrote in a research note to clients today.\nBava is a veteran of Portugal Telecom SGPS SA, which owns 12.1 percent of the investor group known as TmarPart that controls Oi, and 19.4 percent of the Brazilian carrier\u2019s non-voting shares, according to Oi\u2019s annual report. Oi\u2019s stock rallied 17 percent when Bava\u2019s appointment as CEO on June 4 signaled that Lisbon-based Portugal Telecom was taking a more direct leadership interest in the Brazilian carrier.\nCapital Spending\nOi is spending about 6 billion reais this year on infrastructure improvements, the most among peers, after getting more complaints about service from customers than any other Brazilian carrier. The Rio de Janeiro-based company, currently the country\u2019s fourth-biggest mobile service provider, with a 19 percent share of the market, has said it will sell some assets to raise cash.\nA change in Oi\u2019s strategic plan wouldn\u2019t be negative for the company because Bava will take a more active role in operations with the COO position being eliminated, according to Bradesco\u2019s analysts, who maintained the equivalent of a buy recommendation on the stock. \u201cHowever, we still expect the company to face quite difficult short-term circumstances until the changes by the CEO start to yield results,\u201d they wrote.\nThe company said in yesterday\u2019s filing that Bayard Gontijo would replace Zornig as CFO on an interim basis.\nOi\u2019s non-voting shares have lost 57 percent this year, while the Ibovespa (IBOV) has dropped 23 percent.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Denyse Godoy in Sao Paulo at dgodoy2@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: David Papadopoulos at papadopoulos@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "postDate": "2013-06-21T22:15:41", "author": "", "title": "Oi Tumbles as Executive Departures Rekindle Dividend Concern"}, {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-21/copel-falls-as-governor-asks-to-halt-rate-rise-sao-paulo-mover.html", "content": "Copel Falls as Governor Asks to Halt Rate Rise: Sao Paulo Mover\nBy Denyse Godoy - 2013-06-21T16:37:18Z\nCia.

That compares with 32 percent in favor of nuclear power and 20 percent opposed in July 2011.\nConcerns about nuclear power rose in France after a March 2011 earthquake and subsequent tsunami crippled Japan \u2019s Fukushima Dai-Ichi power plant, causing three reactor core meltdowns, forcing about 160,000 people to evacuate and leaving about 132 square kilometers as a no-go zone.\nFrench President Francois Hollande has pledged to cut the country\u2019s reliance on nuclear power. Electricite de France SA \u2019s 58 atomic reactors currently provide more than three-quarters of electricity, a proportion Hollande vowed to reduce to 50 percent by around 2025.\nYet the proportion of people who say France should reduce its dependence on nuclear power because of the energy\u2019s dangers is declining. When surveyed late last month, 41 percent held that view, compared with 46 percent who said in March 2013 that the country should reduce its nuclear dependence, the poll showed.\nThe poll was conducted on May 29 and May 30 among 2,004 people age 18 or older and has a margin of error of 1.8 percentage points.\nRecommendations on France\u2019s planned law on energy policy and the country\u2019s power-production mix will be presented to Hollande in September and the bill will reach parliament at the beginning of 2014, Environment Minister Delphine Batho said on June 5.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Alan Katz in Paris at akatz5@bloomberg.net .\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Melissa Pozsgay at mpozsgay@bloomberg.net .\nMore News:\n", "postDate": "2013-06-22T12:41:12", "author": "", "title": "French Support for Nuclear Power Rises Ahead of Law, Poll Shows"}, {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-21/france-to-raise-natural-gas-supply-to-south-regulator-says.html", "content": "France to Raise Natural Gas Supply to South, Regulator Says\nBy Tara Patel - 2013-06-21T08:35:18Z\nFrance \u2019s natural gas distributor will raise capacity on its North-South link in a bid to prevent a repeat of last summer\u2019s price surge and volatility, according to the regulator.\nGRTgaz SA , the French gas pipeline operator controlled by GDF Suez (GSZ) SA, will offer 15 gigawatt-hours a day of additional capacity this summer, the Commission de Regulation de l\u2019Energie said in a May 29 consultation published on its website . The higher capacity is aimed at encouraging additional gas being sent from north to south, where tight supply last year pushed prices higher.\nThe regulator also called on GRTgaz to limit the effects maintenance work may have on capacity of the North-South link in the coming months. The maximum technical capacity on the link is 450 gigawatt-hours a day at present.\nThe measures are a response to what the regulator called a \u201cdisconnect\u201d since the second quarter of 2012 between prices on the southern and northern French spot natural gas markets. The gap widened between April and September last year when it averaged 2.74 euros ($3.62) a megawatt-hour compared with an average of 0.16 euros a megawatt-hour in 2011. The difference prompted the regulator to start a probe into how prices are determined.\nNo \u201cabnormal behavior\u201d by market participants has been detected so far, the regulator said. The price variations are due to a \u201cmassive\u201d diversion of LNG cargoes from Europe to Asia , where prices are higher, and \u201cstructurally\u201d tighter supply to southern France.\nLNG imports to France\u2019s Fos-sur-Mer terminal in the south fell 18 percent from 2011 to 2012 and 55 percent to Montoir-de-Bretagne, the CRE said. At the same time, French pipeline exports to Spain rose.\nIn its recommendations to improve the flow of natural gas to southern France, the regulator said the southern and northern French markets, known as Point d\u2019Echange de Gaz Sud, or PEG Sud, and PEG Nord, should be merged in 2018.\nTransparency in the usage of France\u2019s LNG terminals also needs to be improved, it said.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Tara Patel in Paris at tpatel2@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Will Kennedy at wkennedy3@bloomberg.net\n", "postDate": "2013-06-21T08:35:18", "author": "", "title": "France to Raise Natural Gas Supply to South, Regulator Says"}, {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-20/koc-joins-garanti-as-companies-draw-erdogan-anger-over-protests.html", "content": "Koc Joins Garanti as Companies Draw Erdogan Ire Over Protest\nBy Ercan Ersoy & Firat Kayakiran - 2013-06-21T14:42:22Z\nAs he denounced extremist groups, opposition parties and international media for stoking the protests of the past few weeks, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan spared some of his ire for local companies.\nKoc Holding AS (KCHOL) , whose businesses range from makers of cars and fridges to financial services, and Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN) , the biggest lender, were among the targets. Addressing hundreds of thousands at an Istanbul rally on June 16, Erdogan referred to a Koc-owned hotel in central Istanbul that allowed its lobby to be turned to an infirmary for protesters sprayed with pepper gas during clashes with police the previous evening.\n\u201cWe know who cooperated with terror in their own hotels,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will have to account for it.\u201d\nWhile there\u2019s been no action against any of the companies, the rhetoric raised concerns in a country with historically an uneasy overlap of business and politics. Media group Dogan Yayin Holding AS (DYHOL) was hit by a $3.8 billion tax fine in 2009 after its newspapers got embroiled in a row with ministers over coverage. The government said it resulted from a routine inspection.\nAfter the first week of protests, Erdogan singled out Garanti Chief Executive Officer Ergun Ozen, saying he would oppose any bank manager who stood with the protesters.\nOzen had described himself as a \u201ccapulcu,\u201d meaning riff-raff or looter, mimicking what Erdogan initially had branded the demonstrators. Cem Boyner, chairman of retail chain Boyner Buyuk Magazacilik AS (BOYNR) , earned a similar rebuke from the premier.\nVendetta Target?\nThe protests created a \u201cgrowing risk that certain high-profile individuals and business entities accused of backing the protesters may become the target of a political vendetta by the government in the aftermath of the crisis,\u201d Wolfango Piccoli , an analyst at London-based political-risk assessor Teneo Intelligence, wrote in a June 16 report.\nGaranti and Koc shares have underperformed this month, both dropping more than 17 percent as of the close in Istanbul today, while the benchmark ISE-100 Index (XU100) declined 15 percent.\n\u201cInvestors are very hesitant in the short-term to buy companies that have been criticized,\u201d Berra Doganer, CEO of Turkish Yatirim AS, a brokerage in Istanbul, said by e-mail. Still, \u201ctheir price levels could offer opportunities to buy for medium and long-term investors,\u201d she said.\nErdogan clashed with Koc before. In 2008, Honorary Chairman Rahmi Koc said he would never hire people with moustaches or beards. The mustachioed Erdogan, whose party has roots in Islamist movements, accused him of \u201cprimitive\u201d discrimination.\nAtaturk Roots\nA Koc Holding communication department official, who didn\u2019t want to be identified because of company policy, declined to comment when contacted by telephone yesterday.\nKoc, which has joint ventures with Fiat SpA (F) and Ford Motor Co. (F) and runs Turkey \u2019s only oil refiner, is one of the country\u2019s older business groups, with roots in the early years of the secular republic founded by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk in 1923.\nIn February, Erdogan\u2019s government canceled a $5.7 billion sale of rights to operate toll roads and bridges to a group including Koc, which had won an auction against two rival bidders two months earlier. It said the price was too low.\nGaranti has been caught in the middle of the political battleground because, even as Erdogan was rebuking its CEO, the bank was targeted by the anti-government protesters. Their anger was directed not at Ozen, but at billionaire Ferit Sahenk.\nSahenk\u2019s Dogus Group, one of Garanti\u2019s main shareholders in partnership with Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) , also owns television stations including news channel NTV. Like other Turkish broadcasters, NTV\u2019s lack of coverage on the first night of the protests over the development of Istanbul\u2019s central square later made it and associated businesses a target.\nBoycott Risk\nClients canceled 1,500 credit cards and pulled as much as 40 million liras ($21 million) from Garanti in the week through June 4 to protest the coverage on Dogus media, Ozen said.\n\u201cCertain companies or shareholders have unwillingly found themselves between two fires as the political environment got increasingly polarized,\u201d Eli Koen, the co-head of emerging Europe equities at Union Bancaire Privee in London , said by e-mail on June 13. \u201cAny company that falls on the wrong side of either party in this conflict carries a risk of boycott.\u201d\nErdogan and other ministers have criticized banks more broadly for being part of an \u201cinterest-rate lobby\u201d seeking to exploit the unrest by pushing borrowing costs up and boosting profits. Erdogan urged depositors to move their money from private to state banks.\n\u201cOur bankers are living in a glass castle,\u201d Deputy Prime Minister Ali Babacan said on June 14. \u201cIf you live in a glass castle you should not throw stones at anybody otherwise the consequences will be bad.\u201d\nRiff-Raff\nErdogan draws his strongest support from among the poorest sections of Turkish society.\nEconomic growth exceeding 5 percent a year during his decade in power has propelled him to three successive election victories, the last one with 50 percent of the vote in 2011. Boyner is also a former politician. His New Democracy movement won less than 1 percent in the 1995 election.\nBoyner displayed support for the protesters by carrying a placard that read: \u201cI\u2019m neither right-wing nor left-wing, I\u2019m riff raff\u201d during demonstrations on June 4.\nFive days later, Erdogan told a crowd in Ankara: \u201cDon\u2019t help these riff-raff prosper. You know, these people have made a living for years off the people\u2019s back.\u201d\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Ercan Ersoy in Istanbul at eersoy@bloomberg.net ; Firat Kayakiran in Istanbul at fkayakiran@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Benedikt Kammel at bkammel@bloomberg.net\nKoc Joins Garanti as Companies Draw Erdogan Anger Over Protests\nKerem Uzel/Bloomberg\nTurkish police stand behind riot shields outside a graffiti-damaged Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS bank branch near Taksim Square in Istanbul, Turkey, on Tuesday, June 11, 2013.\nTurkish police stand behind riot shields outside a graffiti-damaged Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS bank branch near Taksim Square in Istanbul, Turkey, on Tuesday, June 11, 2013.

The BIS, based in Basel , Switzerland and owned by 60 central banks, hosts the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision , a group of regulators and central bankers that sets global capital standards.\n\u201cMarket commentary has suggested that much of this trend reflects banks\u2019 optimization of risk-weighted assets -- the redesign of transactions in order to lower capital requirements -- rather than a genuine increase in loss absorption capacity,\u201d the BIS said. \u201cSuch window-dressing raises questions about the use of internal risk assessments for the determination of regulatory capital requirements .\u201d\nThe BIS adds to a chorus of international regulators that are increasingly looking at leverage, in addition to capital measures based on risk weightings assigned to different assets, to gauge banks\u2019 financial strength. Their focus intensified as some banks improved capital ratios following the financial crisis by altering internal models or cutting risk-weighted assets without correspondingly shrinking their balance sheets.\nUBS AG (UBSN) and Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , the largest Swiss banks, were told last week to increase their ratios of capital to total assets. Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE) , Denmark\u2019s biggest lender, was told by the country\u2019s financial watchdog it had underestimated risky assets. U.S. regulators are considering doubling the ratio of capital to 6 percent of total assets, according to four people with knowledge of the talks who asked not to be named.\nBasel Rules\nLenders in the U.S. and in more than 100 other countries already comply with Basel\u2019s risk-based capital rules, which assign weightings to assets based on their riskiness. Corporate debt is given a heavier weight than government bonds , requiring that more capital be held against it. The weighting affects the profitability of trading and investing in those assets.\nWhile firms submit their models to national regulators for validation, they don\u2019t have to disclose them publicly. Surveys by the Basel Committee have shown that risk-weightings for the same assets vary among banks, undermining their credibility.\n\u201cThe range of variation indicates that the interaction of risk-sensitive rules with the complexity of risk modeling has created a wide scope for inconsistency, which can seriously weaken both the credibility and the effectiveness of the framework,\u201d the BIS said.\nUnwanted Variation\nThe BIS\u2019s analysis based on samples of large globally active banks shows that European lenders\u2019 risk-weighted assets were at 28 percent of total assets at the end of last year, a value that has changed little over the past eight years. The ratio is at 58 percent for U.S. banks, which have reduced it from a peak of 77 percent in 2008. Japanese and U.K. banks have also reduced assets by lowering risk weights over the last five years.\nPart of the difference is due to accounting methods. U.S. rules allow the netting out of derivative positions, while the international standard used by European banks doesn\u2019t and hence inflates total assets of banks such as Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) or BNP Paribas SA (BNP) compared to U.S. peers like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) Different business models also matter.\nStill, even within the same jurisdiction, risk weights can vary widely. There are several factors driving the variation, some of which can be desirable as it allows banks to compete and the market to \u201cbalance the views of bulls and bears,\u201d the BIS said. Distortions come from different parameters used by the lenders, from statistical \u201cnoise\u201d and crucially, from bankers\u2019 optimistic bias.\n\u2018Undermine Efforts\u2019\n\u201cDifferences due to strategic choices by banks are unwelcome because they undermine regulatory efforts,\u201d the BIS said. \u201cManagement interventions in the models skew risk assessments downwards by understating potential loss.\u201d\nTo be sure, the BIS advises against throwing out the risk weighting entirely in favor of relying solely on the leverage ratio , which compares capital against total, unweighted assets. Having only that gauge to measure a bank\u2019s resilience would also create false incentives for banks that could diminish, rather than strengthen stability.\n\u201cThe leverage ratio does not address the problem of incentives,\u201d it said. \u201cFor a given ratio, banks seeking to minimize regulatory capital can simply reallocate their portfolios toward riskier activities, or shrink their balance sheet without necessarily reducing their potential losses.\u201d\n\u2018Harnessing Strengths\u2019\nInstead of just relying on one of the two ratios, regulators should take advantage of the fact that \u201cit is difficult to manipulate one without affecting the other, typically in the opposite direction,\u201d the BIS said. The right response for regulators is \u201charnessing the complementary strengths\u201d while improving the risk weights by more oversight.\nRegulators should address the unwanted variation of weightings by more transparency into the models\u2019 inner workings, as well as by standardization and less discretion for banks in setting their parameters, which would also help to prevent \u201cstatistical noise,\u201d the BIS said.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Boris Groendahl in Vienna at bgroendahl@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Frank Connelly at fconnelly@bloomberg.net\nBanks\u2019 Window-Dressing Undermines Risk-Weight Trust, BIS Says\nLinus Hook/Bloomberg\nDanske Bank A/S, Denmark\u2019s biggest lender, was told by the country\u2019s financial watchdog it had underestimated risky assets.\nDanske Bank A/S, Denmark\u2019s biggest lender, was told by the country\u2019s financial watchdog it had underestimated risky assets.

In Rio de Janeiro, protesters marched peacefully in the beach-side neighborhood of Leblon to the home of Governor Sergio Cabral. Elsewhere in the city smaller groups battled police and sacked storefronts.\nIn her address, delivered from the presidential palace, Rousseff said that her government would maintain order and urged Brazilians to reciprocate the warm hospitality the country\u2019s soccer squad has for decades received abroad and organize a peaceful and orderly World Cup next year.\n\u201cWith respect, warmth and happiness we should treat our guests,\u201d Rousseff said.\nOil Royalties\nRousseff didn\u2019t outline new policy action in the nine-minute speech but instead repeated a pledge to earmark for education 100 percent of the royalties Brazil stands to earn from offshore oil finds.\nShe said she\u2019d meet with protesters to listen to their demands and tap their energy to pursue a pact with local authorities to deliver improvements in public transport. She also endorsed a plan to bring thousands of doctors from abroad to improve the quality of health care at state clinics.\nAfter watching last night from the presidential palace crowds gather in what was the biggest mass protest yet, Rousseff today met with members of her cabinet to discuss emergency measures to quell the violence and seek solutions to demands for better education, health care and other public services.\n\u201cBrazil struggled a lot to become a democratic country and it\u2019s struggling a lot to become a more just country,\u201d she said tonight.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Joshua Goodman in Rio de Janeiro at jgoodman19@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Andre Soliani at asoliani@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "postDate": "2013-06-22T00:55:28", "author": "", "title": "Rousseff Says Violence Embarrassing Brazil Needs to Be Curbed"}, {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-20/rajoy-targets-utility-revenue-to-curb-spanish-debt-loan.html", "content": "Rajoy Targets Utility Revenue to Curb Spanish Debt Loan\nBy Marc Roca - 2013-06-20T23:01:00Z\nSpanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy \u2019s government is preparing to cut the regulated revenue of electric utilities and renewable-energy generators, threatening their profits as it tries to curb the nation\u2019s debt.\nPower producers Iberdrola SA (IBE) and Endesa SA (ELE) along with wind-plant owners Acciona SA (ANA) , Enel Green Power SpA (EGPW) and EDP Renovaveis SA face an earnings decline should their reimbursements be reduced for selling power below market rates, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley (MS) and Macquarie Bank Ltd. The analysts see solar operators being hit hardest.\nDecreasing income for wind- and solar-power plants may undermine some of the 55 billion euros ($73 billion) of loans they\u2019ve taken from banks such as Spain \u2019s Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) , according to Macquarie. Rajoy\u2019s moves follow concerns among governments from Japan to Germany that the prices paid for clean energy subsidies are too high.\n\u201cWe expect regulated revenues to come down for both traditional and renewable operators, though the scale of each reduction remains uncertain,\u201d Morgan Stanley analysts Carolina Dores and Anna Maria Scaglia said in a research note. \u201cWe would avoid stocks with large exposure to electricity\u201d in Spain. Dores declined to be interviewed, citing company policy.\nRajoy is working to rein in a 26 billion-euro ($33.7 billion) debt owed to utilities, a state-guaranteed payback to them in return for selling electricity to consumers at too low a price to cover all their costs. The debt has grown for a decade because regulators cap rates, or tariffs, at levels not high enough to reimburse services such as power transmission and generating from more expensive renewable sources.\nDecision Due\nDecrees with measures to reshape the power system are likely to be sent to the Cabinet for approval this month, according to an Industry Ministry spokesman who asked not to be named, in line with a government policy. Industry Minister Jose Manuel Soria said at a hearing in congress on June 19 the decision might slip until the middle of July.\n\u201cThe increase of unforeseen costs seriously threatens the stability of the power system,\u201d Soria said at the hearing in Madrid . \u201cIt\u2019s threatening the power system. It also threatens, if it continues to grow, the stability of the financial system.\u201d\nThe cuts due in the next few weeks covering the tariff deficit will be followed by a more comprehensive package of changes to rein in costs in the wholesale power market after Parliament\u2019s summer recess, according to JP Morgan and the solar lobby group UNEF.\nUtility Impact\nSpokesmen at each of the electric companies declined to comment. The Association of Spanish Banks has met with ministers to discuss energy reforms, said Encarna Perez, spokeswoman for the group that represents BBVA and its competitors. UNESA, which represents Endesa, Iberdrola, Gas Natural SDG SA (GAS) , EDP and EON AG (EOAN) , said utilities are already suffering from recent measures that reduced revenue by 3.2 billion euros over the past year.\nRenewable energy operators that earn about 6 billion euros a year in subsidies fear more cuts are on the way. Like conventional generators, they were already hit by a 7 percent tax on their revenue in December and a lower allowance for inflation in February.\nSpain\u2019s biggest solar power operators are Fotowatio SL and Grupo T-Solar Global SA. Jorge Barredo, president of the solar lobby group UNEF, expects a cut of about 1.2 billion euros for renewables including limits to earnings of photovoltaic plants. PV plants have been losing 700 million euros a year in revenue since 2011 because of limits on the hours they can earn subsidies.\nReturns Threatened\nThe nation\u2019s six top electricity companies this year have returned 4.1 percent through June 19, compared with a 6.1 percent return by the benchmark Ibex 35 index in the period. Power demand has declined with the recession in Spain, adding to a surplus of generation capacity that\u2019s already as much as 60 percent higher than what\u2019s needed.\nGenerators \u201ccan\u2019t cope with more cuts\u201d because they\u2019re already at the \u201cthreshold of profitability,\u201d Eduardo Montes, president of utilities trade group UNESA, said by phone.\nThe regulated system, which includes transport, distribution and clean energy subsidies, created a 5.6 billion-euro shortfall last year, according to data from the power regulator known by its initials CNE. The other half of consumer bills comes mainly from prices set in the wholesale power market, where companies trade electricity and traditionally have made profits.\nAnalyst Forecasts\nJP Morgan expects immediate measures to cut the regulated power system\u2019s revenue as much as 2.2 billion euros. Renewable energy led by solar may take up to 1.4 billion euros of the cut, lowering 15 percent to 16 percent of what generators earn, the bank said in a June 18 note. It expects earnings to drop 5 percent to 7 percent at Iberdrola and Enel SpA (ENEL) and by as much as 10 percent at Endesa.\nMorgan Stanley sees the government eliminating its forecast of annual gaps of about 4 billion euros by splitting the cost between itself and power generators. It said the distribution-grid operator, Red Electrica (REE) Corporacion SA, is the most exposed, followed by Endesa SA. They could see 2014 earnings reduced by 36 percent and 21 percent, respectively, in the worst-case scenario.\nMacquarie said Acciona\u2019s earnings could fall 35 percent if wind revenue per megawatt-hour is cut by 10 percent. With the same assumption, earnings may drop 22 percent at EDP and 4 percent at both Iberdrola and Enel Green Power. If solar gets a similar 10 percent reduction, Acciona\u2019s profit may drop 50 percent, the bank estimated.\nBank Risk\nBanks including BBVA have been warned to prepare for refinancing loans to the industry, which top 25 billion euros for both solar PV and wind projects and another 5 billion euros for solar thermal projects, according to Macquarie. BBVA declined to comment.\nShai Hill, head of European power research at Macquarie, said he sees a risk of a \u201cradical\u201d restructuring to the power system in a way that would hurt the lowest-cost generators the most -- nuclear and hydropower plants.\n\u201cIf you beat up wind and solar significantly more, we will see multiple project-level bank debt defaults,\u201d Hill said.\nSoria, the industry minister, has said the measures seek to reduce the cost of the regulated power system. The so-called tariff deficit has surged since Spain boosted subsidies for solar power in 2007 and adds to the government\u2019s liabilities, undermining efforts to trim the euro area\u2019s third-biggest budget deficit .\nSoria\u2019s Hints\nNeither Soria nor other ministers have given details about what measures they plan, saying only that they will cut revenue from all regulated activities and guarantee reasonable returns for all technologies.\n\u201cWe are not considering a revision of the feed-in tariffs for renewables,\u201d Soria said at a conference on June 11, according to El Pais. \u201cIt\u2019s about paying them according what the law states, which is a reasonable remuneration, and that there are no differences among regulated activities.\u201d\nThe annual tariff deficit, which generates off-balance sheet liabilities for the state, reached its highest level since 2008 last year.\nBudget Deficit\nSpain\u2019s overall budget gap for 2013 is forecast to be 6.6 percent, according to the International Monetary Fund , trailing only Ireland and Slovenia among the nations sharing the euro. Spain is seeking to reduce the call on taxpayer funds without boosting the cost of power paid by consumers again.\nLuis Crespo, president of the Protermosolar lobby group for solar-thermal project developers, said banks have been warned they \u201cwill have to do something to avoid getting many installations in payment defaults.\u201d\n\u201cIt seems the government has told banks that they will cut payments to renewables and that if they don\u2019t improve financing conditions, operators won\u2019t be able to keep their commitments,\u201d Crespo said. He also said not all technologies should get the same returns because some are more risky.\nSpain has joined Germany, Italy and the U.K. in reducing subsidies for clean energy amid concerns the cost of incentives is driving up power bills for consumers. In Spain, subsidies accounting for almost half of its 20 billion-euro regulated power system, a level the government deems unsustainable.\nA \u201cnew regulatory model\u201d with measures that \u201cwon\u2019t be liked\u201d is absolutely essential, Soria said May 20 in a meeting, according to its minutes.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Marc Roca in London at mroca6@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Reed Landberg at landberg@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "postDate": "2013-06-20T23:01:00", "author": "", "title": "Rajoy Targets Utility Revenue to Curb Spanish Debt Loan"}, {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-21/hutchison-said-close-to-buying-telefonica-s-o2-ireland.html", "content": "Hutchison Said Close to Buying Telefonica\u2019s O2 Ireland\nBy Joe Brennan, Matthew Campbell & Manuel Baigorri - 2013-06-21T18:18:35Z\nHutchison Whampoa Ltd. (13) , controlled by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing , is in advanced talks to buy Telefonica SA (TEF) \u2019s Irish unit, four people with knowledge of the negotiations said.\nAn agreement may be struck before rival bidders are even due to pitch offers on July 5, according to three of the people, who asked not to be named as the talks are private. Telefonica is eager to secure an accord before it publishes interim results at the end of next month, the people said.\nTelefonica, Europe\u2019s most indebted telephone company, may raise more than 700 million euros ($925 million) from the sale of its O2 Ireland unit, two people with knowledge of the matter said June 10. The Madrid-based company has said it wants to cut its net debt to less than 47 billion euros by year end from about 51.2 billion euros.\n\u201cThis is a sensible step toward the company\u2019s goal to cut debt,\u201d said Borja Mijangos, an analyst at Interdin Bolsa in Madrid. \u201cTelefonica will likely sell more assets this year to soothe investors and be in a stronger position for potential M&A activity.\u201d\nEuropean telecommunications firms are seeking to consolidate as growth in mobile-data usage slows and heavy regulation slices profits. If Hutchison and Telefonica\u2019s local units merge, Ireland would join Austria and the U.K. among countries that have recently seen the number of mobile operators shrink.\nFailed Bid\nTelefonica shares fell 0.1 percent to 9.80 euros in Madrid after rising as high as 9.97 euros.\nHutchison\u2019s Three Ireland unit, the third-largest mobile phone operator in the country, failed in its 2 billion-euro bid last year for Eircom Group, Ireland\u2019s largest phone company, when the latter was under court protection from its creditors. Some 1.8 billion euros, or 40 percent, of Eircom\u2019s debt was written off during the process.\nThree Ireland declined to comment in an e-mailed response to questions about any discussions. Telefonica also declined to comment on any talks. The Spanish company is being advised by Bank of America Corp. and Barclays Plc, one person familiar with the matter said.\nOther potential bidders -- including Eircom Group and Liberty Global Inc. (LBTYA) \u2019s UPC Ireland -- have also received information on the sale, a person familiar with the matter said June 10. Telefonica continues to court the other suitors, having given them access to additional data in the past few days, following recent O2 management presentations in Dublin, three people familiar with the current talks said.\nOfficials at Eircom and Liberty Global declined to comment.\nSecond Largest\nO2 is the second largest of five operators in the Irish mobile-phone market, which generated 1.5 billion euros of sales last year. The company\u2019s market share fell to 25 percent in the fourth quarter from 34 percent two years earlier, as Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) , Eircom and Three Ireland added customers, according to ComReg , the Dublin-based communications authority.\nAfter an $85 billion acquisition spree over a decade increased debt and triggered rating cuts, Telefonica Chief Executive Officer Cesar Alierta last year began selling assets. The company is studying ways to raise money from its Colombian unit after it shelved plans to carry out an IPO for the company\u2019s Latin American division mainly because of valuation.\nThe Irish and Czech divisions are high on a list of potential businesses for sale, people familiar with the plans said in April. Other candidates include Telefonica\u2019s remaining minority stake in China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd.\nIn March, Telefonica sold $1.3 billion of treasury stock to reduce debt. A month later it agreed to sell a 40 percent stake in its Central American assets to closely held Corporacion Multi Inversiones to raise $500 million.\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Joe Brennan in Dublin at jbrennan29@bloomberg.net ; Matthew Campbell in London at mcampbell39@bloomberg.net ; Manuel Baigorri in Madrid at mbaigorri@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Heather Smith at hsmith26@bloomberg.net ; Edward Evans at eevans3@bloomberg.net ; Jacqueline Simmons at jackiem@bloomberg.net\nHutchison Said in Advanced Talks to Buy Telefonica\u2019s O2 Ireland\nAidan Crawley/Bloomberg\nThe Irish flag, flies outside an O2 Mobile Phone Store, part of Telefonica SA, on Grafton Street in Dublin.\nThe Irish flag, flies outside an O2 Mobile Phone Store, part of Telefonica SA, on Grafton Street in Dublin.

Both companies\u2019 boards are meeting today to sign off on the deal and an announcement may come tomorrow, the people said.\nBuying Kabel Deutschland would give Vodafone access to the German company\u2019s 8.5 million connected households and potential customers for combined landline, mobile and TV subscriptions. The U.K. company has been vying with Colorado billionaire John Malone \u2019s Liberty Global Plc (LBTYA) , which last week made its own preliminary offer for Kabel that was said to be valued at 85 euros a share.\nVodafone\u2019s 87 euro offer is 37 percent more than Kabel Deutschland\u2019s closing price on Feb. 12, the day before Vodafone\u2019s interest was initially reported, and above its June 21 close of 84.10 euros.\nSimon Gordon, a spokesman for Vodafone, the second-largest wireless carrier in the world, declined to comment. Insa Calsow, a spokeswoman for Kabel Deutschland, also declined to comment.\nEurope Deals\nThe agreement would value Kabel Deutschland\u2019s equity at about 7.7 billion euros and produce an enterprise value, which includes debt, of about 10.7 billion euros, the people said. Vodafone initially offered 80 euros a share before raising to 85 euros and eventually to 87 euros, one of the people said.\nPhone companies across Europe are bulking up their networks and adding services as they work to increase customer bills and loyalty. Bundles of TV, Internet and phone service are becoming increasingly popular, stoking deals and partnerships between carriers.\nMore than $80 billion in telecommunications and cable transactions have been announced or completed this year, as companies from Dish Network Corp. (DISH) to Japan\u2019s SoftBank Corp. (9984) to Vodafone prowl for acquisitions.\nAT&T Inc., the second-largest U.S. wireless carrier, explored potential deals in the past two months including buying part of Telefonica SA (TEF) or some of its foreign assets, three people familiar with the situation said last week.\nRegulation\nKabel Deutschland\u2019s management, led by Chief Executive Officer Adrian von Hammerstein, may have had concerns that Liberty Global \u2019s deal would have run into obstacles from regulators.\nLiberty Global entered Germany, Europe\u2019s biggest telecommunications market, with the acquisition of Unitymedia in 2010. It was forced to take steps such as removing encryptions and opening contracts with housing associations to rivals when it added operator KabelBW the next year to form the country\u2019s second-largest cable operator.\nRegulators have blocked a number of deals recently, leading phone companies to lobby the European Commission, the European Union\u2019s executive arm, for a more lenient regulatory environment.\nKabel Deutschland was blocked by the German antitrust regulator from buying Berlin-based cable operator Tele Columbus Group in February.\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Aaron Kirchfeld in London at akirchfeld@bloomberg.net ; Amy Thomson in London at athomson6@bloomberg.net ; Cornelius Rahn in Berlin at crahn2@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jacqueline Simmons at jackiem@bloomberg.net ; Kenneth Wong at kwong11@bloomberg.net\nVodafone Said to Reach Preliminary EU7.7 Billion Deal With Kabel\nKrisztian Bocsi/Bloomberg\nBuying Kabel Deutschland Holding AG would give Vodafone Group Plc access to the German company\u2019s 8.5 million connected households and potential customers for combined landline, mobile and TV subscriptions in Europe\u2019s biggest telecommunications market.\nBuying Kabel Deutschland Holding AG would give Vodafone Group Plc access to the German company\u2019s 8.5 million connected households and potential customers for combined landline, mobile and TV subscriptions in Europe\u2019s biggest telecommunications market.
