Duration Analysis Model
=========================

General Information
---------------------

Baseline Duration model try to analyze the duration between two high-sigma
events. The duration Analysis Model take the enriched_price_data as input, it
subscribes the queue(tcp://*:30113) which is used in stock_process.py. The
warnning generated by this model will be pushed to queue(tcp://*:30115).

Usage
-----------

python duration_model.py --pub "tcp://*:30115" --sub "tcp://*:30113"


Currently, the model process will not automatically shutdown after starting up,
so it may need one additional process to handle this. 

Because the model listens on queue which containing the enriched_price data generated from stock_process.py,
the duration_model.py should be started up before the running of
stock_process.py.
