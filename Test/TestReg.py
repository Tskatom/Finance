Argentine banks can maintain the amount of savings needed to meet their reserve requirements in their own accounts as previously allowed, the Buenos Aires-based newspaper reported, citing a statement from the central bank.
The move will help sustain liquidity in the banking system and keep interest rates lower, Ambito Financiero reported."""
